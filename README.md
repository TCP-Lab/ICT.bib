This repository attempts to trace all the published scientific works regarding
the _transportome_, defined as the collection of all the membrane proteins
responsible for the translocation of any kind of solutes across the lipid
bilayer.

## Library Structure

The library (accessible in `/Library/`) is divided into two different
*sections*:
- the `Reviews` section collects all reviews about the transportome;
  - the `Cancer` subsection collects all reviews regarding the transportome in
    cancer;
  - the `Non Cancer` section collects all other reviews;
- the `Research Articles` section collects all research articles investigating
  the transportome--or, at least, an entire molecular class of transporters
  (e.g., all SLCs, all ion channels, _etc._).

We manually annotate each article in the library with the following information,
in addition to the standard bibliographical information:
- **Macro-area**: the main scientific area the paper covers (e.g., "Breast
  Cancer", "Cell Motility", "Plants", _etc._);
- **Topic**: the specific topic the paper covers (e.g. "Evolution", "Intestinal
  Inflammation", _etc._);
- **Transportomic Target**: the specific portion (or _layer_) of the
  transportome investigated in the paper, chosen among the following entries:
   - `Ion Channels`
   - `Aquaporins`
   - `Pores` (= `Ion Channels` AND `Aquaporins`)
   - `SLCs` (= solute carriers)
   - `Pumps` (= ATPase pumps)
   - `ABCs` (= ATP-binding cassette transporters)
   - `Transporters` (= `SLCs` AND `Pumps` AND `ABCs`)
   - `ICTs` (= the whole transportome)

Inside each section, the library is organized in four different
*categorizations*, one for each of the above-mentioned manual annotations, plus
by year of publication.

Inside each categorization folder, there is a `README.md` file with an index of
all papers on that section, sorted by the specific categorization criterion.

By navigating into a subsection (e.g., `/Library/Reviews/Cancer/by year/2022/`)
you will find one file per publication, with information such as DOI, Journal of
publication, abstract, and more.
Each subsection also contains one `.library.bib` file with the bibliographical
information of all the papers in that subsection in `.bib` format, for ease of
inclusion in bibliography managers.

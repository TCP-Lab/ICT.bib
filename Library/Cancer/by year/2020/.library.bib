 abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is a devastating disease with a dismal prognosis. Therapeutic interventions are largely ineffective. A better understanding of the pathophysiology is required. Ion channels contribute substantially to the “hallmarks of cancer.” Their expression is dysregulated in cancer, and they are “misused” to drive cancer progression, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Ion channels are located in the cell membrane at the interface between the intracellular and extracellular space. They sense and modify the tumor microenvironment which in itself is a driver of PDAC aggressiveness. Ion channels detect, for example, locally altered proton and electrolyte concentrations or mechanical stimuli and transduce signals triggered by these microenvironmental cues through association with intracellular signaling cascades. While these concepts have been firmly established for other cancers, evidence has emerged only recently that ion channels are drivers of PDAC aggressiveness. Particularly, they appear to contribute to two of the characteristic PDAC features: the massive fibrosis of the tumor stroma (desmoplasia) and the efficient immune evasion. Our critical review of the literature clearly shows that there is still a remarkable lack of knowledge with respect to the contribution of ion channels to these two typical PDAC properties. Yet, we can draw parallels from ion channel research in other fibrotic and inflammatory diseases. Evidence is accumulating that pancreatic stellate cells express the same “profibrotic” ion channels. Similarly, it is at least in part known which major ion channels are expressed in those innate and adaptive immune cells that populate the PDAC microenvironment. We explore potential therapeutic avenues derived thereof. Since drugs targeting PDAC-relevant ion channels are already in clinical use, we propose to repurpose those in PDAC. The quest for ion channel targets is both motivated and complicated by the fact that some of the relevant channels, for example, KCa3.1, are functionally expressed in the cancer, stroma, and immune cells. Only in vivo studies will reveal which arm of the balance we should put our weights on when developing channel-targeting PDAC therapies. The time is up to explore the efficacy of ion channel targeting in (transgenic) murine PDAC models before launching clinical trials with repurposed drugs.},

@article{Marin2020,
 abstract = {The dismal prognosis of patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is due, in part, to the extreme resistance of this type of liver cancer to available chemotherapeutic agents. Among the complex mechanisms accounting for CCA chemoresistance are those involving the impairment of drug uptake, which mainly occurs through transporters of the superfamily of solute carrier (SLC) proteins, and the active export of drugs from cancer cells, mainly through members of families B, C and G of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins. Both mechanisms result in decreased amounts of active drugs able to reach their intracellular targets. Therefore, the "cancer transportome", defined as the set of transporters expressed at a given moment in the tumor, is an essential element for defining the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype of cancer cells. For this reason, during the last two decades, plasma membrane transporters have been envisaged as targets for the development of strategies aimed at sensitizing cancer cells to chemotherapy, either by increasing the uptake or reducing the export of antitumor agents by modulating the expression/function of SLC and ABC proteins, respectively. Moreover, since some elements of the transportome are differentially expressed in CCA, their usefulness as biomarkers with diagnostic and prognostic purposes in CCA patients has been evaluated.},

@article{Schnipper2020,
 abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths in United States and Europe. It is predicted that PDAC will become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths during the next decades. The development of PDAC is not well understood, however, studies have shown that dysregulated exocrine pancreatic fluid secretion can contribute to pathologies of exocrine pancreas, including PDAC. The major roles of healthy exocrine pancreatic tissue are secretion of enzymes and bicarbonate rich fluid, where ion channels participate to fine-tune these biological processes. It is well known that ion channels located in the plasma membrane regulate multiple cellular functions and are involved in the communication between extracellular events and intracellular signaling pathways and can function as signal transducers themselves. Hereby, they contribute to maintain resting membrane potential, electrical signaling in excitable cells, and ion homeostasis. Despite their contribution to basic cellular processes, ion channels are also involved in the malignant transformation from a normal to a malignant phenotype. Aberrant expression and activity of ion channels have an impact on essentially all hallmarks of cancer defined as; uncontrolled proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, sustained angiogenesis and promotion of invasion and migration. Research indicates that certain ion channels are involved in the aberrant tumor growth and metastatic processes of PDAC. The purpose of this review is to summarize the important expression, localization, and function of ion channels in normal exocrine pancreatic tissue and how they are involved in PDAC progression and development. As ion channels are suggested to be potential targets of treatment they are furthermore suggested to be biomarkers of different cancers. Therefore, we describe the importance of ion channels in PDAC as markers of diagnosis and clinical factors.},

@article{Yuan2020,
 abstract = {Gastric cancer (GC) is a highly invasive and fatal malignant disease that accounts for 5.7% of new global cancer cases and is the third leading cause of cancer-related death. Acid/base homeostasis is critical for organisms because protein and enzyme function, cellular structure, and plasma membrane permeability change with pH. Various ion transporters are expressed in normal gastric mucosal epithelial cells and regulate gastric acid secretion, ion transport, and fluid absorption, thereby stabilizing the differentiation and homeostasis of gastric mucosal epithelial cells. Ion transporter dysfunction results in disordered ion transport, mucosa barrier dysfunction, and acid/base disturbances, causing gastric acid-related diseases such as chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) and GC. This review summarizes the physiological functions of multiple ion transporters and channels in the stomach, including Cl- channels, Cl-/HCO3- exchangers, sodium/hydrogen exchangers (NHEs), and potassium (K+) channels, and their pathophysiological relevance in GC.},

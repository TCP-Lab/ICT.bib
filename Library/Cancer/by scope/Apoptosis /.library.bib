 abstract = {Humans maintain a constant cell number throughout their lifespan. This equilibrium of cell number is accomplished when cell proliferation and cell death are kept balanced, achieving a steady-state cell number. Abnormalities in cell growth or cell death can lead to an overabundance of cells known as neoplasm or tumours. While the perception of cancer is often that of an uncontrollable rate of cell growth or increased proliferation, a decrease in cell death can also lead to tumour formation. Most cells when detached from their normal tissue die. However, cancer cells evade cell death, tipping the balance to an overabundance of cell number. Therefore, overcoming this resistance to cell death is a decisive factor in the treatment of cancer. Ion channels play a critical role in cancer in regards to cell proliferation, malignant angiogenesis, migration and metastasis. Additionally, ion channels are also known to be critical components of apoptosis. In this review, we discuss the modes of cell death focusing on the ability of cancer cells to evade apoptosis. Specifically, we focus on the role ion channels play in controlling and regulating life/death decisions and how they can be used to overcome resistance to apoptosis in the treatment of cancer. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

 abstract = {Apoptosis, a type of genetically controlled cell death, is a fundamental cellular mechanism utilized by multicellular organisms for disposal of cells that are no longer needed or potentially detrimental. Given the crucial role of apoptosis in physiology, deregulation of apoptotic machinery is associated with various diseases as well as abnormalities in development. Acquired resistance to apoptosis represents the common feature of most and perhaps all types of cancer. Therefore, repairing and reactivating apoptosis represents a promising strategy to fight cancer. Accumulated evidence identifies ion channels as essential regulators of apoptosis. However, the contribution of specific ion channels to apoptosis varies greatly depending on cell type, ion channel type and intracellular localization, pathology as well as intracellular signaling pathways involved. Here we discuss the involvement of major types of ion channels in apoptosis regulation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane channels and transporters in cancers.},

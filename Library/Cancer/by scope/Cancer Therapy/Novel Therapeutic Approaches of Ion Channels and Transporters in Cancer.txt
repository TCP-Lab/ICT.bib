Abstract:
    The expression and function of many ion channels and transporters in cancer cells display major differences in comparison to those from healthy cells. These differences provide the cancer cells with advantages for tumor development. Accordingly, targeting ion channels and transporters have beneficial anticancer effects including inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis, tumor vascularization, and chemotherapy resistance, as well as promoting apoptosis. Some of the molecular mechanisms associating ion channels and transporters with cancer include the participation of oxidative stress, immune response, metabolic pathways, drug synergism, as well as noncanonical functions of ion channels. This diversity of mechanisms offers an exciting possibility to suggest novel and more effective therapeutic approaches to fight cancer. Here, we review and discuss most of the current knowledge suggesting novel therapeutic approaches for cancer therapy targeting ion channels and transporters. The role and regulation of ion channels and transporters in cancer provide a plethora of exceptional opportunities in drug design, as well as novel and promising therapeutic approaches that may be used for the benefit of cancer patients.

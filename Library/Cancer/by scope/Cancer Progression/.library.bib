 abstract = {Vascularization is crucial for solid tumour growth and invasion, providing metabolic support and sustaining metastatic dissemination. It is now accepted that ion channels and transporters play a significant role in driving the cancer growth at all stages. They may represent novel therapeutic, diagnostic and prognostic targets for anti-cancer therapies. On the other hand, although the expression and role of ion channels and transporters in the vascular endothelium is well recognized and subject of recent reviews, only recently has their involvement in tumour vascularization been recognized. Here, we review the current literature on ion channels and transporters directly involved in the angiogenic process. Particular interest will be focused on tumour angiogenesis in vivo as well as in the different steps that drive this process in vitro, such as endothelial cell proliferation, migration, adhesion and tubulogenesis. Moreover, we compare the 'transportome' system of tumour vascular network with the physiological one. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

@article{Litan2015,
 abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that ion channels and pumps not only regulate membrane potential, ion homeostasis, and electric signaling in excitable cells but also play important roles in cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and differentiation. Consistent with a role in cell signaling, channel proteins and ion pumps can form macromolecular complexes with growth factors, and cell adhesion and other signaling molecules. And while cancer is still not being cataloged as a channelopathy, as the non-traditional roles of ion pumps and channels are being recognized, it is increasingly being suggested that ion channels and ion pumps contribute to cancer progression. Cancer cell migration requires the regulation of adhesion complexes between migrating cells and surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Cell movement along solid surfaces requires a sequence of cell protrusions and retractions that mainly depend on regulation of the actin cytoskeleton along with contribution of microtubules and molecular motor proteins such as mysoin. This process is triggered and modulated by a combination of environmental signals, which are sensed and integrated by membrane receptors, including integrins and cadherins. Membrane receptors transduce these signals into downstream signaling pathways, often involving the Rho GTPase protein family. These pathways regulate the cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary for proper timing of adhesion, contraction and detachment of cells in order to find their way through extracellular spaces. Migration and adhesion involve continuous modulation of cell motility, shape and volume, in which ion channels and pumps play major roles. Research on cancer cells suggests that certain ion channels may be involved in aberrant tumor growth and channel inhibitors often lead to growth arrest. This review will describe recent research into the role of ion pumps and ion channels in cell migration and adhesion, and how they may contribute to tumor development.},

@article{Martial2016,
 abstract = {Angiogenesis is a finely tuned process, which is the result of the equilibrium between pro- and antiangiogenic factors. In solid tumor angiogenesis, the balance is highly in favor of the production of new, but poorly functional blood vessels, initially intended to provide growing tumors with nutrients and oxygen. Among the numerous proteins involved in tumor development, several types of ion channels are overexpressed in tumor cells, as well as in stromal and endothelial cells. Ion channels thus actively participate in the different hallmarks of cancer, especially in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Indeed, from their strategic localization in the plasma membrane, ion channels are key operators of cell signaling, as they sense and respond to environmental changes. This review aims to decipher how ion channels of different families are intricately involved in the fundamental angiogenesis and metastasis hallmarks, which lead from a nascent tumor to systemic dissemination. An overview of the possible use of ion channels as therapeutic targets will also be given, showing that ion channel inhibitors or specific antibodies may provide effective tools, in the near future, in the treatment of carcinomas.},

@article{Munaron2015,
 abstract = {Solid tumors require the formation of new blood vessels to support their growth, invasiveness and metastatic potential. Tumor neovascularization is achieved by vasculogenesis from endothelial precursors and by sprouting angiogenesis from preexisting vessels. The complex sequence of events driving these processes, including endothelial activation, proliferation, migration and differentiation, is associated with fluxes of ions, water and other small molecules mediated by a great pool of ion channels and transporters (ICT). This 'transportome' is regulated by environmental factors as well as intracellular signaling molecules. In turn, ICT play a prominent role in the response to angiogenesis-related stimuli through canonical and 'unconventional' activities: indeed, there is an increasing recognition of the multifunctionality of several ion channels that could also be annotated as receptors, enzymes, scaffolding proteins, mechanical and chemical sensors. The investigation of ICT structure and function has been far from the experimental oncology for long time and these two domains converged only very recently. Furthermore, the systems biology viewpoint has not received much attention in the biology of cancer transportome. Modulating angiogenesis by interference with membrane transport has a great potential in cancer treatment and the application of an 'omics' logic will hopefully contribute to the overall advancement in the field. This review is an attempt to apply the systems biology approach to the analysis of ICT involved in tumor angiogenesis, with a particular focus on endothelial transportome diversity.

 abstract = {Cell migration is a central component of the metastatic cascade requiring a concerted action of ion channels and transporters (migration-associated transportome), cytoskeletal elements and signalling cascades. Ion transport proteins and aquaporins contribute to tumour cell migration and invasion among other things by inducing local volume changes and/or by modulating Ca2+ and H+ signalling. Targeting cell migration therapeutically bears great clinical potential, because it is a prerequisite for metastasis. Ion transport proteins appear to be attractive candidate target proteins for this purpose because they are easily accessible as membrane proteins and often overexpressed or activated in cancer. Importantly, a number of clinically widely used drugs are available whose anticipated efficacy as anti-tumour drugs, however, has now only begun to be evaluated. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

@article{Stock2015,
 abstract = {An elaborate interplay between ion channels and transporters, components of the cytoskeleton, adhesion molecules, and signaling cascades provides the basis for each major step of the metastatic cascade. Ion channels and transporters contribute to cell motility by letting through or transporting ions essential for local Ca2 +, pH and - in cooperation with water permeable aquaporins - volume homeostasis. Moreover, in addition to the actual ion transport they, or their auxiliary subunits, can display non-conducting activities. They can exert kinase activity in order to phosphorylate cytoskeletal constituents or their associates. They can become part of signaling processes by permeating Ca2 +, by generating local pH-nanodomains or by being final downstream effectors. A number of channels and transporters are found at focal adhesions, interacting directly or indirectly with proteins of the extracellular matrix, with integrins or with components of the cytoskeleton. We also include the role of aquaporins in cell motility. They drive the outgrowth of lamellipodia/invadopodia or control the number of $β$1 integrins in the plasma membrane. The multitude of interacting ion channels and transporters (called transportome) including the associated signaling events holds great potential as therapeutic target(s) for anticancer agents that are aimed at preventing metastasis.

@article{Stock2022,
 abstract = {Survival in the circulation, extravasation from vasculature, and colonizing new tissues represent major steps of the metastatic cascade and pose a big challenge for metastasizing tumor cells. Tumor cells circulating in blood and lymph vessels need to overcome anoikis, cope with mechanical stimuli including shear stress, and defeat attacks by the immune system. Once adhered to the vessel wall, a circulating tumor cell (CTC) can trick the endothelial cells into loosening their intercellular junctions so that the endothelium becomes penetrable for the tumor cell. Since tumor cells tend to metastasize to predestinated target organs and tissues, called organotropism, the distribution of metastases is anything but random. The molecular-physiological mechanisms underlying CTC survival, extravasation, and organotropism are very likely to include the presence and activity of ion channels/transporters due to the latter's key function in cytophysiological processes. To date, a very limited number of studies explicitly show the involvement of ion transport. This review describes the contribution of ion channels and transporters to CTC survival, extravasation, and organotropism where known and possible. In addition, supposed connections between ion transport and CTC behavior are demonstrated and imply the potential to be therapeutically taken advantage of.},

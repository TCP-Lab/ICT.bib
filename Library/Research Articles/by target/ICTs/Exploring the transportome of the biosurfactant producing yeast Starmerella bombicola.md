### Abstract

Starmerella bombicola is a non-conventional yeast mainly known for its capacity to produce high amounts of the glycolipids â€˜sophorolipids'. Although its product has been used as biological detergent for a couple of decades, the genetics of S. bombicola are still largely unknown. Computational analysis of the yeast's genome enabled us to identify 254 putative transporter genes that make up the entire transportome. For each of them, a potential substrate was predicted using homology analysis, subcellular localization prediction and RNA sequencing in different stages of growth. One transporter family is of exceptional importance to this yeast: the ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter Superfamily, because it harbors the main driver behind the highly efficient sophorolipid export. Furthermore, members of this superfamily translocate a variety of compounds ranging from antibiotics to hydrophobic molecules. We conducted an analysis of this family by creating deletion mutants to understand their role in the export of hydrophobic compounds, antibiotics and sophorolipids. Doing this, we could experimentally confirm the transporters participating in the efflux of medium chain fatty alcohols, particularly decanol and undecanol, and identify a second sophorolipid transporter that is located outside the sophorolipid biosynthetic gene cluster.

### Abstract

Chinese mitten crab (CMC) or Eriocheir sinensis is a strong osmoregulator that can keep rigorous cellular homeostasis. CMC can flourish in freshwater, as well as seawater, habitats and represents the most important species for freshwater aquaculture. Salt stress can have direct effects on several stages (e.g., reproduction, molting, growth, etc.) of the CMC life cycle. To get a better overview of the genes involved in the gills of CMC under different salinity conditions, we conducted an RNA-Seq meta-analysis on the transcriptomes of four publicly available datasets. The meta-analysis identified 405 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs), of which 40% were classified into various transporter classes, including accessory factors and primary active transporters as the major transport classes. A network analysis of the DETs revealed that adaptation to salinity is a highly regulated mechanism in which different functional modules play essential roles. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to conduct a transcriptome meta-analysis of gills from crab RNA-Seq datasets under salinity. Additionally, this study is also the first to focus on the differential expression of diverse transporters and channels (transportome) in CMC. Our meta-analysis opens new avenues for a better understanding of the osmoregulation mechanism and the selection of potential transporters associated with salinity change.

### Abstract

This study characterized functional ion channels in cultured undifferentiated human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from bone marrow with whole-cell patch clamp and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques. Three types of outward currents were found in hMSCs, including a noise-like rapidly activating outward current inhibited by the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (IKCa) blocker iberiotoxin, a transient outward K+ current (Ito) suppressed by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and a delayed rectifier K+ current (IKDR)-like ether-à-go-go (eag) K+ channel. In addition, tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium current (INa.TTX) and nifedipine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ current (ICa.L) were also detected in 29% and 15% hMSCs, respectively. Moreover, RT-PCR revealed the molecular evidence of high levels of mRNA for the functional ionic currents, including human MaxiK for IKCa, Kv4.2 and Kv1.4 for Ito, heag1 for IKDR, hNE-Na for INa.TTX, and CACNAIC for I Ca.L. These results demonstrate that multiple functional ion channel currents-that is, IKca, Ito heag1, INa.TTX, and ICa.L-are expressed in hMSCs from bone marrow.

 abstract = {Owing to intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance, the response of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) to chemotherapy is very poor. Here we have investigated the role of transportome in reducing the intracellular content of anticancer drugs and conferring multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. Tumors specimens and paired adjacent tissue were analyzed to determine the MDR signature by TaqMan Low-Density Arrays and single-gene qPCR. Strategies of sensitization were evaluated in vitro using the GAC-derived cell line AGS and in vivo using a subcutaneous xenograft model in immunodeficient nude mice. Several transporters involved in drug uptake and export, which are present in healthy stomach, were highly expressed in GAC. In contrast, the cancer-type OATP1B3 was almost exclusively expressed in tumor tissue. The transportome profile varied depending on tumor anatomical location, differentiation, and stage. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed high MRP1 and MRP4 expression at the plasma membrane of tumor cells as well as AGS cells in culture, in which MRP inhibition resulted in selective sensitization to cytotoxic MRP substrates, such as sorafenib, docetaxel, etoposide, and doxorubicin. In mice with subcutaneous tumors formed by AGS cells, sorafenib alone failed to prevent tumor growth. In contrast, this drug induced a marked inhibitory effect when it was co-administered with diclofenac. In conclusion, MRP1 and MRP4 play an important role in the lack of response of GAC to drugs that are transported by these export pumps. Moreover, agents, such as sorafenib, considered at present useless to treat GAC, may become active antitumor drugs when co-administered with non-toxic MRP inhibitors, such as diclofenac.},

@article{Grane-Boladeras2016,
 abstract = {In this study, we have addressed the pharmacogenomic basis of the response of gastrointestinal tumors to six anticancer drugs using a panel of fifteen cell lines derived from pancreatic, stomach and biliary tract cancers. We determined the constitutive expression levels of 96 genes, whose encoded proteins contribute to drug action, and identified a major gene network that contains broad selectivity nucleoside transporter genes, as well as several genes known to be involved in cell proliferation and survival. All cell lines were exposed to 5′-DFUR, 5-FU, gemcitabine, cisplatin, doxorubicin and paclitaxel for 48 h and cell response was measured using MTT assays. We correlated the cell response of the fifteen cell lines with the mRNA expression of the selected 96 genes and identified sets of 4–5 genes whose expression profiles correlated to responsiveness to each anticancer drug. These genes may be good candidates as response predictors to such therapies.},

@article{Huang2004,
 abstract = {Membrane transporters and channels (collectively the transportome) govern cellular influx and efflux of ions, nutrients, and drugs. We used oligonucleotide arrays to analyze gene expression of the transportome in 60 human cancer cell lines used by the National Cancer Institute for drug screening. Correlating gene expression with the potencies of 119 standard anticancer drugs identified known drug-transporter interactions and suggested novel ones. Folate, nucleoside, and amino acid transporters positively correlated with chemosensitivity to their respective drug substrates. We validated the positive correlation between SLC29A1 (nucleoside transporter ENT1) expression and potency of nucleoside analogues, azacytidine and inosine-glycodialdehyde. Application of an inhibitor of SLC29A1, nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside, significantly reduced the potency of these two drugs, indicating that SLC29A1 plays a role in cellular uptake. Three ABC efflux transporters (ABCB1, ABCC3, and ABCB5) showed significant negative correlations with multiple drugs, suggesting a mechanism of drug resistance. ABCB1 expression correlated negatively with potencies of 19 known ABCB1 substrates and with Baker's antifol and geldanamycin. Use of RNA interference reduced ABCB1 mRNA levels and concomitantly increased sensitivity to these two drugs, as expected for ABCB1 substrates. Similarly, specific silencing of ABCB5 by small interfering RNA increased sensitivity to several drugs in melanoma cells, implicating ABCB5 as a novel chemoresistance factor. Ion exchangers, ion channels, and subunits of proton and sodium pumps variably correlated with drug potency. This study identifies numerous potential drug-transporter relationships and supports a prominent role for membrane transport in determining chemosensitivity. Measurement of transporter gene expression may prove useful in predicting anticancer drug response.},

@article{Theile2011,
 abstract = {Background. Multidrug resistance (MDR) hampers chemotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). There is little information about MDR mediating drug transporters in HNSCC. Methods. Nine HNSCC cell lines were characterized concerning drug transporter expression and susceptibility to cisplatin, paclitaxel, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) using a DNA microarray and proliferation assays. Three cells lines were precisely investigated for transporter expression using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and drug resistance before and after simulated chemotherapies. Results. The cell lines differed in drug resistance and transporter expression. Cisplatin and paclitaxel resistances were inversely associated. Drugs rendered HNSCC cells resistant, cross-resistant, or cross-sensitive. Sensitivity changes were accompanied by transporter mRNA expression changes. Conclusion. Paclitaxel was identified as a potent inducer of numerous drug transporters and phenotypic MDR in HNSCC. Thus, cytostatic susceptibility of HNSCC cannot exclusively be deduced from the expression of single transporters but more likely of the entire transportome and non-transporter modulators. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

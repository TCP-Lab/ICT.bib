 abstract = {Background: The human pancreatic cancer cell line A818-6 can be grown in vitro either as a highly malignant, undifferentiated monolayer (ML) or as three-dimensional (3D) single layer hollow spheres (HS) simulating a benign, highly differentiated, duct-like pancreatic epithelial structure. This characteristic allowing A818-6 cells to switch from one phenotype to another makes these cells a unique system to characterize the cellular and molecular modifications during differentiation on one hand and malignant transformation on the other hand. Ion channels and transport proteins (transportome) have been implicated in malignant transformation. Therefore, the current study aimed to analyse the transportome gene expression profile in the A818-6 cells growing as a monolayer or as hollow spheres. Methods & Results: The study identified the differentially expressed transportome genes in both cellular states of A818-6 using Agilent and Nanostring arrays and some targets were validated via immunoblotting. Additionally, these results were compared to a tissue Affymetrix microarray analysis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients' tissues. The overall transcriptional profile of the ML and HS cells confirmed the formerly described mesenchymal features of ML and epithelial nature of HS which was further verified via high expression of E-cadherin and low expression of vimentin found in HS in comparison to ML. Among the predicted features between HS and ML was the involvement of miRNA-9 in this switch. Importantly, the bioinformatics analysis also revealed substantial number (n = 126) of altered transportome genes. Interestingly, three genes upregulated in PDAC tissue samples (GJB2, GJB5 and SLC38A6) were found to be also upregulated in ML and 3 down-regulated transportome genes (KCNQ1, TRPV6 and SLC4A) were also reduced in ML. Conclusion: This reversible HS/ML in vitro system might help in understanding the pathophysiological impact of the transportome in the dedifferentiation process in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the HS/ML model represents a novel system for studying the role of the transportome during the switch from a more benign, differentiated (HS) to a highly malignant, undifferentiated (ML) phenotype.},

 abstract = {The altered expression and/or activity of ion channels and transporters (transportome) have been associated with malignant behavior of cancer cells and were proposed to be a hallmark of cancer. However, the impact of altered transportome in epithelial cancers, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), as well as its pathophysiological consequences, still remains unclear. Here, we report the in silico analysis of 840 transportome genes in PDAC patients' tissues. Our study was focused on the transportome changes and their correlation with functional and behavioral responses in PDAC tumor and stromal compartments. The dysregulated gene expression datasets were filtered using a cut-off of fold-change values ≤−2 or ≥2 (adjusted p value ≤0.05). The dysregulated transportome genes were clearly associated with impaired physiological secretory mechanisms and/or pH regulation, control of cell volume, and cell polarity. Additionally, some down-regulated transportome genes were found to be closely linked to epithelial cell differentiation. Furthermore, the observed decrease in genes coding for calcium and chloride transport might be a mechanism for evasion of apoptosis. In conclusion, the current work provides a comprehensive overview of the altered transportome expression and its association with predicted PDAC malignancy with special focus on the epithelial compartment.},

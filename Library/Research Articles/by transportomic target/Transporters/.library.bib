 abstract = {Owing to intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance, the response of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) to chemotherapy is very poor. Here we have investigated the role of transportome in reducing the intracellular content of anticancer drugs and conferring multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. Tumors specimens and paired adjacent tissue were analyzed to determine the MDR signature by TaqMan Low-Density Arrays and single-gene qPCR. Strategies of sensitization were evaluated in vitro using the GAC-derived cell line AGS and in vivo using a subcutaneous xenograft model in immunodeficient nude mice. Several transporters involved in drug uptake and export, which are present in healthy stomach, were highly expressed in GAC. In contrast, the cancer-type OATP1B3 was almost exclusively expressed in tumor tissue. The transportome profile varied depending on tumor anatomical location, differentiation, and stage. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed high MRP1 and MRP4 expression at the plasma membrane of tumor cells as well as AGS cells in culture, in which MRP inhibition resulted in selective sensitization to cytotoxic MRP substrates, such as sorafenib, docetaxel, etoposide, and doxorubicin. In mice with subcutaneous tumors formed by AGS cells, sorafenib alone failed to prevent tumor growth. In contrast, this drug induced a marked inhibitory effect when it was co-administered with diclofenac. In conclusion, MRP1 and MRP4 play an important role in the lack of response of GAC to drugs that are transported by these export pumps. Moreover, agents, such as sorafenib, considered at present useless to treat GAC, may become active antitumor drugs when co-administered with non-toxic MRP inhibitors, such as diclofenac.},

 abstract = {Nutrient transfer is a key feature of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. Valuable mineral nutrients are transferred from the AM fungus to the plant, increasing its fitness and productivity, and, in exchange, the AM fungus receives carbohydrates as an energy source from the plant. Here, we analyzed the transcriptome of the Populus trichocarpa-Rhizophagus irregularis symbiosis using RNA-sequencing of non-mycorrhizal or mycorrhizal fine roots, with a focus on the effect of nitrogen (N) starvation. In R. irregularis, we identified 1,015 differentially expressed genes, whereby N starvation led to a general induction of gene expression. Genes of the functional classes of cell growth, membrane biogenesis and cell structural components were highly abundant. Interestingly, N starvation also led to a general induction of fungal transporters, indicating increased nutrient demand upon N starvation. In non-mycorrhizal P. trichocarpa roots, 1,341 genes were differentially expressed under N starvation. Among the 953 down-regulated genes in N starvation, most were involved in metabolic processes including amino acids, carbohydrate and inorganic ion transport, while the 342 up-regulated genes included many defense-related genes. Mycorrhization led to the up-regulation of 549 genes mainly involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis and transport; only 24 genes were down-regulated. Mycorrhization specifically induced expression of three ammonium transporters and one phosphate transporter, independently of the N conditions, corroborating the hypothesis that these transporters are important for symbiotic nutrient exchange. In conclusion, our data establish a framework of gene expression in the two symbiotic partners under high-N and low-N conditions.},

 abstract = {In arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, key components of nutrient uptake and exchange are specialized transporters that facilitate nutrient transport across membranes. As phosphate is a nutrient and a regulator of nutrient exchanges, we investigated the effect of P availability to extraradical mycelium (ERM) on both plant and fungus transcriptomes and metabolomes in a symbiocosm system. By perturbing nutrient exchanges under the control of P, our objectives were to identify new fungal genes involved in nutrient transports, and to characterize in which extent the fungus differentially modulates its metabolism when interacting with two different plant species. We performed transportome analysis on the ERM and intraradical mycelium of the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis associated to Populus trichocarpa and Sorghum bicolor under high and low P availability in ERM, using quantitative RT-PCR and Illumina mRNA-sequencing. We observed that mycorrhizal symbiosis induces expression of specific phosphate and ammonium transporters in both plants. Furthermore, we identified new AM-inducible transporters and showed that a subset of phosphate transporters is regulated independently of symbiotic nutrient exchange. mRNA-Sequencing revealed that the fungal transportome was not similarly regulated in the two host plant species according to P availability. Mirroring this effect, many plant carbohydrate transporters were down-regulated in P. trichocarpa mycorrhizal root tissue. Metabolome analysis revealed further that AM root colonization led to a modification of root primary metabolism under low and high P availability and to a decrease of primary metabolite pools in general. Moreover, the down regulation of the sucrose transporters suggests that the plant limits carbohydrate long distance transport (i.e. from shoot to the mycorrhizal roots). By simultaneous uptake/reuptake of nutrients from the apoplast at the biotrophic interface, plant and fungus are both able to control reciprocal nutrient fluxes.},

We report here the complete transportome of MFS proteins of a human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. RESULTS: Computational analysis of C. albicans genome enabled us to identify 95 potential MFS proteins which clustered into 17 families using Saier's Transport Commission (TC) system. Among these SP, DHA1, DHA2 and ACS represented major families consisting of 22, 22, 9 and 16 members, respectively. Family designations in C. albicans were validated by subjecting Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome to TC system. Based on the published available genomics/proteomics data, 87 of the putative MFS genes of C. albicans were found to express either at mRNA or protein levels. We checked the expression of the remaining 8 genes by using RT-PCR and observed that they are not expressed under basal growth conditions implying that either these 8 genes are expressed under specific growth conditions or they may be candidates for pseudogenes. CONCLUSION: The in silico characterisation of MFS transporters in Candida albicans genome revealed a large complement of MFS transporters with most of them showing expression. Considering the clinical relevance of C. albicans and role of MFS members in antifungal resistance and nutrient transport, this analysis would pave way for identifying their physiological relevance.},

 abstract = {ATP-binding cassette (ABC) is one of the two major superfamilies of transporters present across the evolutionary scale. ABC superfamily members came to prominence due to their ability to extrude broad spectrum of substrates and to confer multi drug resistance (MDR). Overexpression of some ABC transporters in clinical isolates of Candida species was attributed to the development of MDR phenotypes. Among Candida species, Candida glabrata is an emerging drug resistant species in human fungal infections. A comprehensive analysis of such proteins in C. glabrata is required to untangle their role not only in MDR but also in other biological processes. Bioinformatic analysis of proteins encoded by genome of human pathogenic yeast C. glabrata identified 25 putative ABC protein coding genes. On the basis of phylogenetic analysis, domain organization and nomenclature adopted by the Human Genome Organization (HUGO) scheme, these proteins were categorized into six subfamilies such as Pleiotropic Drug Resistance (PDR)/ABCG, Multi Drug Resistance (MDR)/ ABCB, Multi Drug Resistance associated Protein (MRP)/ABCC, Adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDp)/ABCD, RNase L Inhibitor (RLI)/ABCE and Elongation Factor 3 (EF3)/ABCF. Among these, only 18 ABC proteins contained transmembrane domains (TMDs) and were grouped as membrane proteins, predominantly belonging to PDR, MDR, MRP, and ALDp subfamilies. A comparative phylogenetic analysis of these ABC proteins with other yeast species revealed their orthologous relationship and pointed towards their conserved functions. Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of putative membrane localized ABC protein encoding genes of C. glabrata confirmed their basal expression and showed variable transcriptional response towards antimycotic drugs. This study presents first comprehensive overview of ABC superfamily proteins of a human fungal pathogen C. glabrata, which is expected to provide an important platform for in depth analysis of their physiological relevance in cellular processes and drug resistance.},

 abstract = {CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing allows rapid, simultaneous modification of multiple genetic loci in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, this technique was used in a functional analysis study aimed at identifying the hitherto unknown mechanism of lactate export in this yeast. First, an S. cerevisiae strain was constructed with deletions in 25 genes encoding transport proteins, including the complete aqua(glycero)porin family and all known carboxylic acid transporters. The 25-deletion strain was then transformed with an expression cassette for Lactobacillus casei lactate dehydrogenase (LcLDH). In anaerobic, glucose-grown batch cultures this strain exhibited a lower specific growth rate (0.15 vs. 0.25 h-1) and biomass-specific lactate production rate (0.7 vs. 2.4 mmol g biomass-1 h-1) than an LcLDH-expressing reference strain. However, a comparison of the two strains in anaerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures (dilution rate 0.10 h-1) showed identical lactate production rates. These results indicate that, although deletion of the 25 transporter genes affected the maximum specific growth rate, it did not impact lactate export rates when analysed at a fixed specific growth rate. The 25-deletion strain provides a first step towards a 'minimal transportome' yeast platform, which can be applied for functional analysis of specific (heterologous) transport proteins as well as for evaluation of metabolic engineering strategies.},

This increase may be due to the high affinity of solute-binding proteins for solutes, permitting the acquisition of a broad range of growth-limiting nutrients from soil and the rhizosphere. The transcriptional induction of these transporters was studied by creating a suite of plasmid and integrated fusions to nearly all ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters of Sinorhizobium meliloti. In total, specific inducers were identified for 76 transport systems, amounting to approximately 47% of the ABC uptake systems and 53% of the TRAP transporters in S. meliloti. Of these transport systems, 64 are previously uncharacterized in Rhizobia and 24 were induced by solutes not known to be transported by ABC- or TRAP-uptake systems in any organism.

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of biological processes that replace the existing petrochemical-based industry is one of the biggest challenges in biotechnology. Aspergillus niger is one of the main industrial producers of lignocellulolytic enzymes, which are used in the conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks into fermentable sugars. Both the hydrolytic enzymes responsible for lignocellulose depolymerisation and the molecular mechanisms controlling their expression have been well described, but little is known about the transport systems for sugar uptake in A. niger. Understanding the transportome of A. niger is essential to achieve further improvements at strain and process design level. Therefore, this study aims to identify and classify A. niger sugar transporters, using newly developed tools for in silico and in vivo analysis of its membrane-associated proteome. RESULTS: In the present research work, a hidden Markov model (HMM), that shows a good performance in the identification and segmentation of functionally validated glucose transporters, was constructed. The model (HMMgluT) was used to analyse the A. niger membrane-associated proteome response to high and low glucose concentrations at a low pH. By combining the abundance patterns of the proteins found in the A. niger plasmalemma proteome with their HMMgluT scores, two new putative high-affinity glucose transporters, denoted MstG and MstH, were identified. MstG and MstH were functionally validated and biochemically characterised by heterologous expression in a S. cerevisiae glucose transport null mutant. They were shown to be a high-affinity glucose transporter (K m~=~0.5~$±~$0.04~mM) and a very high-affinity glucose transporter (K m~=~0.06~$±~$0.005~mM), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study, focusing for the first time on the membrane-associated proteome of the industrially relevant organism A. niger, shows the global response of the transportome to the availability of different glucose concentrations. Analysis of the A. niger transportome with the newly developed HMMgluT showed to be an efficient approach for the identification and classification of new glucose transporters.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Global climate change and fossil fuels limitations have boosted the demand for robust and efficient microbial factories for the manufacturing of bio-based products from renewable feedstocks. In this regard, efforts have been done to enhance the enzyme-secreting ability of lignocellulose-degrading fungi, aiming to improve protein yields while taking advantage of their ability to use lignocellulosic feedstocks. Access to sugars in complex polysaccharides depends not only on their release by specific hydrolytic enzymes, but also on the presence of transporters capable of effectively transporting the constituent sugars into the cell. This study aims to identify and characterize xylose transporters from Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma reesei, two fungi that have been industrially exploited for decades for the production of lignocellulose-degrading hydrolytic enzymes. RESULTS: A hidden Markov model for the identification of xylose transporters was developed and used to analyze the A. niger and T. reesei in silico proteomes, yielding a list of candidate xylose transporters. From this list, three A. niger (XltA, XltB and XltC) and three T. reesei (Str1, Str2 and Str3) transporters were selected, functionally validated and biochemically characterized through their expression in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae hexose transport null mutant, engineered to be able to metabolize xylose but unable to transport this sugar. All six transporters were able to support growth of the engineered yeast on xylose but varied in affinities and efficiencies in the uptake of the pentose. Amino acid sequence analysis of the selected transporters showed the presence of specific residues and motifs recently associated to xylose transporters. Transcriptional analysis of A. niger and T. reesei showed that XltA and Str1 were specifically induced by xylose and dependent on the XlnR/Xyr1 regulators, signifying a biological role for these transporters in xylose utilization. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the existence of a variety of xylose transporters in the cell factories A. niger and T. reesei. The particular substrate specificity and biochemical properties displayed by A. niger XltA and XltB suggested a possible biological role for these transporters in xylose uptake. New insights were also gained into the molecular mechanisms regulating the pentose utilization, at inducer uptake level, in these fungi. Analysis of the A. niger and T. reesei predicted transportome with the newly developed hidden Markov model showed to be an efficient approach for the identification of new xylose transporting proteins.},

 abstract = {Background. Multidrug resistance (MDR) hampers chemotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). There is little information about MDR mediating drug transporters in HNSCC. Methods. Nine HNSCC cell lines were characterized concerning drug transporter expression and susceptibility to cisplatin, paclitaxel, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) using a DNA microarray and proliferation assays. Three cells lines were precisely investigated for transporter expression using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and drug resistance before and after simulated chemotherapies. Results. The cell lines differed in drug resistance and transporter expression. Cisplatin and paclitaxel resistances were inversely associated. Drugs rendered HNSCC cells resistant, cross-resistant, or cross-sensitive. Sensitivity changes were accompanied by transporter mRNA expression changes. Conclusion. Paclitaxel was identified as a potent inducer of numerous drug transporters and phenotypic MDR in HNSCC. Thus, cytostatic susceptibility of HNSCC cannot exclusively be deduced from the expression of single transporters but more likely of the entire transportome and non-transporter modulators. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

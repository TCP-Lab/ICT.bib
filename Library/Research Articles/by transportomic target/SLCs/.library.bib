 abstract = {The fluid in the 14 distinct segments of the renal tubule undergoes sequential transport processes that gradually convert the glomerular filtrate into the final urine. The solute carrier (SLC) family of proteins is responsible for much of the transport of ions and organic molecules along the renal tubule. In addition, some SLC family proteins mediate housekeeping functions by transporting substrates for metabolism. Here, we have developed a curated list of SLC family proteins. We used the list to produce resource webpages that map these proteins and their transcripts to specific segments along the renal tubule. The data were used to highlight some interesting features of expression along the renal tubule including sex-specific expression in the proximal tubule and the role of accessory proteins ($β$-subunit proteins) that are thought to be important for polarized targeting in renal tubule epithelia. Also, as an example of application of the data resource, we describe the patterns of acid-base transporter expression along the renal tubule.},

 abstract = {Cystic kidney diseases (CKDs) affect millions of people worldwide. The defining pathological features are fluid-filled cysts developing from nephric tubules due to defective flow sensing, cell proliferation and differentiation. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood, and the derived excretory systems of established invertebrate models (Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) are unsuitable to model CKDs. Systematic structure/function comparisons revealed that the combination of ultrafiltration and flow-associated filtrate modification that is central to CKD etiology is remarkably conserved between the planarian excretory system and the vertebrate nephron. Consistently, both RNA-mediated genetic interference (RNAi) of planarian orthologues of human CKD genes and inhibition of tubule flow led to tubular cystogenesis that share many features with vertebrate CKDs, suggesting deep mechanistic conservation. Our results demonstrate a common evolutionary origin of animal excretory systems and establish planarians as a novel and experimentally accessible invertebrate model for the study of human kidney pathologies.},

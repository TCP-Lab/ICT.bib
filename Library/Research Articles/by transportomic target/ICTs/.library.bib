 abstract = {Purpose. The purpose of this work was to study the influence of cell differentiation on the mRNA expression of transporters and channels in Caco-2 cells and to assess Caco-2 cells as a model for carriermediated drug transport in the intestines. Method. Gene mRNA expression was measured using a custom-designed microarray chip with 750 deoxyoligonucleotide probes (70mers). Each oligomer was printed four times on poly-lysine-coated glass slides. Expression profiles were expressed as ratio values between fluorescence intensities of Cy3 and Cy5 dye-labeled cDNA derived from poly(A) + RNA samples of Caco-2 cells and total RNA of human intestines. Results. Significant differences in the mRNA expression profile of transporters and channels were observed upon differentiation of Caco-2 cells from 5 days to 2 weeks in culture, including changes for MAT8, S-protein, and Nramp2. Comparing Caco-2 cells of different passage number revealed few changes in mRNAs except for GLUT3, which was down-regulated 2.4-fold within 13 passage numbers. Caco-2 cells had a similar expression profile when either cultured in flasks or on filters but differed more strongly from human small and large intestine, regardless of the differentiation state of Caco-2 cells. Expression of several genes highly transcribed in small or large intestines differed fourfold or more in Caco-2 cells. Conclusions. Although Caco-2 cells have proven a suitable model for studying carrier-mediated transport in human intestines, the expression of specific transporter and ion channel genes may differ substantially.},

 abstract = {Background: Lichens, encompassing 20,000 known species, are symbioses between specialized fungi (mycobionts), mostly ascomycetes, and unicellular green algae or cyanobacteria (photobionts). Here we describe the first parallel genomic analysis of the mycobiont Cladonia grayi and of its green algal photobiont Asterochloris glomerata. We focus on genes/predicted proteins of potential symbiotic significance, sought by surveying proteins differentially activated during early stages of mycobiont and photobiont interaction in coculture, expanded or contracted protein families, and proteins with differential rates of evolution. Results: A) In coculture, the fungus upregulated small secreted proteins, membrane transport proteins, signal transduction components, extracellular hydrolases and, notably, a ribitol transporter and an ammonium transporter, and the alga activated DNA metabolism, signal transduction, and expression of flagellar components. B) Expanded fungal protein families include heterokaryon incompatibility proteins, polyketide synthases, and a unique set of G-protein $α$ subunit paralogs. Expanded algal protein families include carbohydrate active enzymes and a specific subclass of cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrases. The alga also appears to have acquired by horizontal gene transfer from prokaryotes novel archaeal ATPases and Desiccation-Related Proteins. Expanded in both symbionts are signal transduction components, ankyrin domain proteins and transcription factors involved in chromatin remodeling and stress responses. The fungal transportome is contracted, as are algal nitrate assimilation genes. C) In the mycobiont, slow-evolving proteins were enriched for components involved in protein translation, translocation and sorting. Conclusions: The surveyed genes affect stress resistance, signaling, genome reprogramming, nutritional and structural interactions. The alga carries many genes likely transferred horizontally through viruses, yet we found no evidence of inter-symbiont gene transfer. The presence in the photobiont of meiosis-specific genes supports the notion that sexual reproduction occurs in Asterochloris while they are free-living, a phenomenon with implications for the adaptability of lichens and the persistent autonomy of the symbionts. The diversity of the genes affecting the symbiosis suggests that lichens evolved by accretion of many scattered regulatory and structural changes rather than through introduction of a few key innovations. This predicts that paths to lichenization were variable in different phyla, which is consistent with the emerging consensus that ascolichens could have had a few independent origins.},

 abstract = {Treponema is a diverse bacterial genus, the species of which can be pathogenic, symbiotic, or free living. These treponemes can cause various diseases in humans and other animals, such as periodontal disease, bovine digital dermatitis and animal skin lesions. However, the most important and well-studied disease of treponemes that affects humans is ‘syphilis'. This disease is caused by Treponema pallidum subspecie pallidum with 11–12 million new cases around the globe on an annual basis. In this study we analyze the transportome of ten Treponema species, with emphasis on the types of encoded transport proteins and their substrates. Of the ten species examined, two (T. primitia and T. azonutricium) reside as symbionts in the guts of termites; six (T. pallidum, T. paraluiscuniculi, T. pedis, T. denticola, T. putidum and T. brennaborense) are pathogens of either humans or animals, and T. caldarium and T. succinifaciens are avirulent species, the former being thermophilic. All ten species have a repertoire of transport proteins that assists them in residing in their respective ecological niches. For instance, oral pathogens use transport proteins that take up nutrients uniquely present in their ecosystem; they also encode multiple multidrug/macromolecule exporters that protect against antimicrobials and aid in biofilm formation. Proteins of termite gut symbionts convert cellulose into other sugars that can be metabolized by the host. As often observed for pathogens and symbionts, several of these treponemes have reduced genome sizes, and their small genomes correlate with their dependencies on the host. Overall, the transportomes of T. pallidum and other pathogens have a conglomerate of parasitic lifestyle-assisting proteins. For example, a T. pallidum repeat protein (TprK) mediates immune evasion; outer membrane proteins (OMPs) allow nutrient uptake and end product export, and several ABC transporters catalyze sugar uptake, considered pivotal to parasitic lifestyles. Taken together, the results of this study yield new information that may help open new avenues of treponeme research.},

 abstract = {Starmerella bombicola is a non-conventional yeast mainly known for its capacity to produce high amounts of the glycolipids ‘sophorolipids'. Although its product has been used as biological detergent for a couple of decades, the genetics of S. bombicola are still largely unknown. Computational analysis of the yeast's genome enabled us to identify 254 putative transporter genes that make up the entire transportome. For each of them, a potential substrate was predicted using homology analysis, subcellular localization prediction and RNA sequencing in different stages of growth. One transporter family is of exceptional importance to this yeast: the ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter Superfamily, because it harbors the main driver behind the highly efficient sophorolipid export. Furthermore, members of this superfamily translocate a variety of compounds ranging from antibiotics to hydrophobic molecules. We conducted an analysis of this family by creating deletion mutants to understand their role in the export of hydrophobic compounds, antibiotics and sophorolipids. Doing this, we could experimentally confirm the transporters participating in the efflux of medium chain fatty alcohols, particularly decanol and undecanol, and identify a second sophorolipid transporter that is located outside the sophorolipid biosynthetic gene cluster.},

@article{Darbani2018,
 abstract = {Background: Transporter proteins mediate the translocation of substances across the membranes of living cells. Many transport processes are energetically expensive and the cells use 20 to 60% of their energy to power the transportomes. We hypothesized that there may be an evolutionary selection pressure for lower energy transporters. Results: We performed a genome-wide analysis of the compositional reshaping of the transportomes across the kingdoms of bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. We found that the share of ABC transporters is much higher in bacteria and archaea (ca. 27% of the transportome) than in primitive eukaryotes (13%), algae and plants (10%) and in fungi and animals (5-6%). This decrease is compensated by an increased occurrence of secondary transporters and ion channels. The share of ion channels is particularly high in animals (ca. 30% of the transportome) and algae and plants with (ca. 13%), when compared to bacteria and archaea with only 6-7%. Therefore, our results show a move to a preference for the low-energy-demanding transporters (ion channels and carriers) over the more energy-costly transporter classes (ATP-dependent families, and ABCs in particular) as part of the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. The transportome analysis also indicated seven bacterial species, including Neorickettsia risticii and Neorickettsia sennetsu, as likely origins of the mitochondrion in eukaryotes, based on the phylogenetically restricted presence therein of clear homologues of modern mitochondrial solute carriers. Conclusions: The results indicate that the transportomes of eukaryotes evolved strongly towards a higher energetic efficiency, as ATP-dependent transporters diminished and secondary transporters and ion channels proliferated. These changes have likely been important in the development of tissues performing energetically costly cellular functions.},

 abstract = {Escherichia coli is a genetically diverse species that can be pathogenic, probiotic, commensal, or a harmless laboratory strain. Pathogenic strains of E. coli cause urinary tract infections, diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and pyelonephritis, while the two known probiotic E. coli strains combat inflammatory bowel disease and play a role in immunomodulation. Salmonella enterica, a close relative of E. coli, includes two important pathogenic serovars, Typhi and Typhimurium, causing typhoid fever and enterocolitis in humans, respectively, with the latter strain also causing a lethal typhoid fever-like disease in mice. In this study, we identify the transport systems and their substrates within seven E. coli strains: two probiotic strains, two extracellular pathogens, two intracellular pathogens, and K-12, as well as the two intracellular pathogenic S. enterica strains noted above. Transport systems characteristic of each probiotic or pathogenic species were thus identified, and the tabulated results obtained with all of these strains were compared. We found that the probiotic and pathogenic strains generally contain more iron-siderophore and sugar transporters than E. coli K-12. Pathogens have increased numbers of pore-forming toxins, protein secretion systems, decarboxylation-driven Na+ exporters, electron flow-driven monovalent cation exporters, and putative transporters of unknown function compared to the probiotic strains. Both pathogens and probiotic strains encode metabolite transporters that reflect their intracellular versus extracellular environments. The results indicate that the probiotic strains live extracellularly. It seems that relatively few virulence factors can convert a beneficial or commensal microorganism into a pathogen. Taken together, the results reveal the distinguishing features of these strains and provide a starting point for future engineering of beneficial enteric bacteria.},

 abstract = {The anal papillae of mosquito larvae are osmoregulatory organs in direct contact with the external aquatic environment that actively sequester ions and take up water in dilute freshwater. In the disease vector Aedes aegypti mechanisms of ion, water and ammonia transport have only been partially resolved. Furthermore, A. aegypti larvae are known to reside in high ammonia sewage and high salt brackish waters, and understanding of anal papillae function in these conditions is in its infancy. The objective of this study was to identify the complement of ion and water transport genes expressed by the anal papillae of freshwater larvae by sequencing their transcriptome, and comparing their expression in anal papillae of larvae abruptly transferred to brackish water for 24 h. Results identified a number of ion and water transport proteins, ammonia detoxifying enzymes, a full suite of xenobiotic detoxifying enzymes and transporters, and G-protein coupled receptors of specific hormones. We identified a marked increase in transcript and protein abundance of aquaporin AaAQP2 in the anal papillae with abrupt transfer to brackish water. We present an updated and more comprehensive model for ion and water transport with additional putative transporters for Na+ and Cl- uptake in the anal papillae. These are organs which are actively engaged in Na+, Cl- and water uptake and regulation when the aquatic larvae encounter fluctuating salinities over the course of their development. Furthermore the transcriptome of the anal papillae includes a full set of xenobiotic detoxification genes suggesting that these are important detoxification organs which is particularly important when larvae reside in polluted water.},

 abstract = {Chromium (Cr) as a toxic metal is widely used for commercial purposes and its residues have become a potential environmental threat to both human and plant health. Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) is one of the candidate plants that can absorb the considerable quantity of toxic metals from the soil. Here, we used two cultivars of B. napus cvs. ZS 758 (metal-tolerant) and Zheda 622 (metal-susceptible) to investigate the phenological attributes, cell ultrastructure, protein kinases (PKs) and molecular transporters (MTs) under the combined treatments of Cr stress and reduced glutathione (GSH). Seeds of these cultivars were grown in vitro at different treatments i.e., 0, 400 $μ$M Cr, and 400 $μ$M Cr + 1 mM GSH in control growth chamber for 6 days. Results had confirmed that Cr significantly reduced the plant length, stem and root, and fresh biomass such as leaf, stem and root. Cr noticeably caused the damages in leaf mesophyll cells. Exogenous application of GSH significantly recovered both phenological and cell structural damages in two cultivars under Cr stress. For the PKs, transcriptomic data advocated that Cr stress alone significantly increased the gene expressions of BnaA08g16610D, BnaCnng19320D, and BnaA08g00390D over that seen in controls (Ck). These genes encoded both nucleic acid and transition metal ion binding proteins, and protein kinase activity (PKA) and phosphotransferase activities in both cultivars. Similarly, the presence of Cr revealed elite MT genes [BnaA04g26560D, BnaA02g28130D, and BnaA02g01980D (novel)] that were responsible for water transmembrane transporter activity. However, GSH in combination with Cr stress significantly up-regulated the genes for PKs [such as BnaCnng69940D (novel) and BnaC08g49360D] that were related to PKA, signal transduction, and oxidoreductase activities. For MTs, BnaC01g29930D and BnaA07g14320D were responsible for secondary active transmembrane transporter and protein transporter activities that were expressed more in GSH treatment than either Ck or Cr-treated cells. In general, it can be concluded that cultivar ZS 758 is more tolerant toward Cr-induced stress than Zheda 622.},

We also surveyed expression of transporter genes in the poplar rust fungus for which transcriptomics data are available across the whole life cycle. Despite a significant increase in gene number, rust fungi presented a reduced transportome compared with most fungi in the Dikarya. However, a few transporter families in the subclass Porters showed significant expansions. Notably, three metal transport-related families involved in the import, export, and sequestration of metals were expanded in Pucciniales and expressed at various stages of the rust life cycle, suggesting a tight regulation of metal homeostasis. The most remarkable gene expansion in the Pucciniales was observed for the oligopeptide transporter (OPT) family, with 25 genes on average compared with seven to 14 genes in the other surveyed taxonomical ranks. A phylogenetic analysis showed several specific expansion events at the root of the order Pucciniales with subsequent expansions in rust taxonomical families. The OPT genes showed dynamic expression patterns along the rust life cycle and more particularly during infection of the poplar host tree, suggesting a possible specialization for the acquisition of nitrogen and sulfur through the transport of oligopeptides from the host during biotrophic growth.},

 abstract = {Aims: The mechanisms underlying the fetal origin of renal disease remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the profiles of ion channel and transporter proteins in the fetal kidney in fetal growth restriction (FGR)rats, and to explore their association with the fetal origin of renal disease. Main methods: An FGR rat model was developed by administration of a low-protein diet. Then 367 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) from quantitative proteome analysis were subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. 22 DEPs associated with ion channels/transporters were evaluated in the fetal kidney. Na+/H+ exchanger1(NHE1) and its downstream unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway were investigated. Furthermore, overexpression of NHE1 were achieved via plasmid transfection to evaluate the potential influence on the UPR pathway and cell apoptosis in human proximal tubular epithelial cell line HK2 cells. Key findings: Findings were as follows: 1) In the FGR fetal kidney, aquaporin 2/4, solute carrier (SLC) 8a1, 33a1, etc. were downregulated, whereas other transporters including SLC 2a1, 4a1, 9a1, 29a3, etc. were upregulated. 2) NHE1 mRNA levels were markedly elevated in the FGR fetus. Further investigation revealed an increase in the UPR pathway regulators. 3) In vitro study showed that NHE1 overexpression in HK2 cells significantly induced expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) regulators and led to a decrease in the anti-apoptotic potential. Significance: We speculate that maternal protein malnutrition causes dysregulation of ion channels/transporters in the fetal kidney. Upregulated NHE1 may activate the UPR pathway and induce cell apoptosis thus leading to impairment of kidney function.},

 abstract = {Membrane transporters and channels (collectively the transportome) govern cellular influx and efflux of ions, nutrients, and drugs. We used oligonucleotide arrays to analyze gene expression of the transportome in 60 human cancer cell lines used by the National Cancer Institute for drug screening. Correlating gene expression with the potencies of 119 standard anticancer drugs identified known drug-transporter interactions and suggested novel ones. Folate, nucleoside, and amino acid transporters positively correlated with chemosensitivity to their respective drug substrates. We validated the positive correlation between SLC29A1 (nucleoside transporter ENT1) expression and potency of nucleoside analogues, azacytidine and inosine-glycodialdehyde. Application of an inhibitor of SLC29A1, nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside, significantly reduced the potency of these two drugs, indicating that SLC29A1 plays a role in cellular uptake. Three ABC efflux transporters (ABCB1, ABCC3, and ABCB5) showed significant negative correlations with multiple drugs, suggesting a mechanism of drug resistance. ABCB1 expression correlated negatively with potencies of 19 known ABCB1 substrates and with Baker's antifol and geldanamycin. Use of RNA interference reduced ABCB1 mRNA levels and concomitantly increased sensitivity to these two drugs, as expected for ABCB1 substrates. Similarly, specific silencing of ABCB5 by small interfering RNA increased sensitivity to several drugs in melanoma cells, implicating ABCB5 as a novel chemoresistance factor. Ion exchangers, ion channels, and subunits of proton and sodium pumps variably correlated with drug potency. This study identifies numerous potential drug-transporter relationships and supports a prominent role for membrane transport in determining chemosensitivity. Measurement of transporter gene expression may prove useful in predicting anticancer drug response.},

This genetic redundancy severely hampers current efforts to uncover novel phenotypes, delaying basic genetic research and breeding programmes. Here we describe the development and validation of Multi-Knock, a genome-scale clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat toolbox that overcomes functional redundancy in Arabidopsis by simultaneously targeting multiple gene-family members, thus identifying genetically hidden components. We computationally designed 59,129 optimal single-guide RNAs that each target two to ten genes within a family at once. Furthermore, partitioning the library into ten sublibraries directed towards a different functional group allows flexible and targeted genetic screens. From the 5,635 single-guide RNAs targeting the plant transportome, we generated over 3,500 independent Arabidopsis lines that allowed us to identify and characterize the first known cytokinin tonoplast-localized transporters in plants. With the ability to overcome functional redundancy in plants at the genome-scale level, the developed strategy can be readily deployed by scientists and breeders for basic research and to expedite breeding efforts.},

However, new algorithms to analyze genome sequence information in the context of community structure are needed to enhance our understanding of the specific ecological roles of these organisms in soil environments. We present a machine learning approach using sequenced Pseudomonad genomes coupled with outputs of metabolic and transportomic computational models for identifying the most predictive molecular mechanisms indicative of a Pseudomonad's ecological role in the rhizosphere: a biofilm, biocontrol agent, promoter of plant growth, or plant pathogen. Computational predictions of ecological niche were highly accurate overall with models trained on transportomic model output being the most accurate (Leave One Out Validation F-scores between 0.82 and 0.89). The strongest predictive molecular mechanism features for rhizosphere ecological niche overlap with many previously reported analyses of Pseudomonad interactions in the rhizosphere, suggesting that this approach successfully informs a system- scale level understanding of how Pseudomonads sense and interact with their environments. The observation that an organism's transportome is highly predictive of its ecological niche is a novel discovery and may have implications in our understanding microbial ecology. The framework developed here can be generalized to the analysis of any bacteria across a wide range of environments and ecological niches making this approach a powerful tool for providing insights into functional predictions from bacterial genomic data.},

 abstract = {Chinese mitten crab (CMC) or Eriocheir sinensis is a strong osmoregulator that can keep rigorous cellular homeostasis. CMC can flourish in freshwater, as well as seawater, habitats and represents the most important species for freshwater aquaculture. Salt stress can have direct effects on several stages (e.g., reproduction, molting, growth, etc.) of the CMC life cycle. To get a better overview of the genes involved in the gills of CMC under different salinity conditions, we conducted an RNA-Seq meta-analysis on the transcriptomes of four publicly available datasets. The meta-analysis identified 405 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs), of which 40% were classified into various transporter classes, including accessory factors and primary active transporters as the major transport classes. A network analysis of the DETs revealed that adaptation to salinity is a highly regulated mechanism in which different functional modules play essential roles. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to conduct a transcriptome meta-analysis of gills from crab RNA-Seq datasets under salinity. Additionally, this study is also the first to focus on the differential expression of diverse transporters and channels (transportome) in CMC. Our meta-analysis opens new avenues for a better understanding of the osmoregulation mechanism and the selection of potential transporters associated with salinity change.},

In this study, we hypothesised that CPCs derived from OA cartilage may be characterised by a distinct channelome. First, a global transcriptomic analysis using Affymetrix microarrays was performed. We studied the profiles of those ion channels and transporter families that may be relevant to chondroprogenitor cell physiology. Following validation of the microarray data with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we examined the role of calcium-dependent potassium channels in CPCs and observed functional large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels involved in the maintenance of the chondroprogenitor phenotype. In line with our very recent results, we found that the KCNMA1 gene was upregulated in CPCs and observed currents that could be attributed to the BK channel. The BK channel inhibitor paxilline significantly inhibited proliferation, increased the expression of the osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2, enhanced the migration parameters, and completely abolished spontaneous Ca2+ events in CPCs. Through characterisation of their channelome we demonstrate that CPCs are a distinct cell population but are highly similar to MSCs in many respects. This study adds key mechanistic data to the in-depth characterisation of CPCs and their phenotype in the context of cartilage regeneration.},

Proteotypic peptides were selected and isotopically labeled heavy versions were used for technical optimization and for quantification of the corresponding light version in biological samples. This approach allowed to quantify simultaneously nine PIPs in leaf membranes and 13 PIPs together with three autoinhibited H+ATPases, two ammonium transporters, and two NRTs in root membranes. Similarly, it was used to investigate the effect of a salt stress on the expression of these latter 20 transporters in roots. These novel isoform-specific data were compared with published transcriptome information and revealed a close correlation between PIP isoforms and transcripts levels.

 abstract = {Background and aims: Several transport alterations have been described in intestinal inflammatory diseases. This is relevant because the primary function of the intestine is nutrient and mineral absorption. However, analysis of the transportome as a whole and the effect of commensal bacteria on it have not been addressed so far. Methods: Five healthy and 6 Crohn's disease (CD) samples were hybridized to human HT-12 V4 Illumina GeneChip. Results were validated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and with additional array data. Organ culture assays were performed from mucosa ileal wall specimens collected at surgery. Samples were incubated with or without commensal bacteria for 4 hours. Finally, RNA was isolated for microarray processing. Results: The analysis of CD versus healthy ileal mucosa demonstrated upregulation of previously described genes involved in immunity and the inflammatory response in this disease. Interestingly, whole transcriptional analysis revealed profound alterations in the transportome profile. Sixty-two solute carrier (SLC) transporters displayed different expression patterns, most of them being downregulated. Changes were confirmed by RT-PCR in a randomly chosen subset of SLCs. A large number of amino acid transporters and most members of the enteric purinome were found to be altered. Most of these proteins were found at the apical membrane of the enterocyte, which could impair both amino acid absorption and purinergic signalling. Treatment of ileum specimen explants with commensal bacteria restored almost all CD transportome alterations. Conclusions: These results describe the altered transportome profile in CD and open the possibility of restoring transportome complications with commensal bacteria.},

As an important tropical crop restricted to specific regions of the world, coffee production is highly susceptible to the effects of environmental instabilities (i.e., local year-to-year weather fluctuations and global climate change) and threatening pest pressures, not to mention an increasing quality rigor by consumers in industrialized countries. Specialized metabolites are substances that largely affect plant-environment interactions as well as how consumers experience agricultural products. Membrane transporters are key targets, albeit understudied, for understanding and tailoring the spatiotemporal distribution of specialized metabolites as they mediate and control molecular trafficking and substance accumulation. Therefore, we analyzed the transportome of C. canephora encoded within the 25,574 protein-coding genes annotated in the genome of this species and identified 1847 putative membrane transporters. Following, we mined 152 transcriptional profiles of C. canephora and C. arabica and performed a comprehensive co-expression analysis to identify transporters potentially involved in the accumulation of specialized metabolites associated with beverage quality and bioactivity attributes. In toto, this report points to an avenue of possibilities on Coffea genomic and transcriptomic data mining for genetic breeding strategies, which can lead to the development of new, resilient varieties for more sustainable coffee production systems.},

Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) are a source of tumor formation and recurrence in glioblastoma multiforme, a highly aggressive brain cancer, suggesting that ion channel expression may be perturbed in this population. However, little is known about the expression and functional relevance of ion channels that may contribute to GSC malignancy. Using RNA sequencing, we assessed the enrichment of ion channels in GSC isolates and non-tumor neural cell types. We identified a unique set of GSC-enriched ion channels using differential expression analysis that is also associated with distinct gene mutation signatures. In support of potential clinical relevance, expression of selected GSC-enriched ion channels evaluated in human glioblastoma databases of The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project correlated with patient survival times. Finally, genetic knockdown as well as pharmacological inhibition of individual or classes of GSC-enriched ion channels constrained growth of GSCs compared to normal neural stem cells. This first-in-kind global examination characterizes ion channels enriched in GSCs and explores their potential clinical relevance to glioblastoma molecular subtypes, gene mutations, survival outcomes, regional tumor expression, and experimental responses to loss-of-function. Together, the data support the potential biological and therapeutic impact of ion channels on GSC malignancy and provide strong rationale for further examination of their mechanistic and therapeutic importance.},

However, the organization of the three-domain tree of life has been challenged following the discovery of archaeal lineages such as the TACK and Asgard superphyla. The Asgard Superphylum has emerged as the closest archaeal ancestor to eukaryotes, potentially improving our understanding of the evolution of life forms. We characterized the transportomes and their substrates within four metagenome- assembled genomes (MAGs), that is, Odin-, Thor-, Heimdall- and Loki-archaeota as well as the fully sequenced genome of Candidatus Prometheoarchaeum syntrophicum strain MK-D1 that belongs to the Loki phylum. Using the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) as reference, candidate transporters encoded within the proteomes were identified based on sequence similarity, alignment coverage, compatibility of hydropathy profiles, TMS topologies and shared domains. Identified transport systems were compared within the Asgard superphylum as well as within dissimilar eukaryotic, archaeal and bacterial organisms. From these analyses, we infer that Asgard organisms rely mostly on the transport of substrates driven by the proton motive force (pmf), the proton electrochemical gradient which then can be used for ATP production and to drive the activities of secondary carriers. The results indicate that Asgard archaea depend heavily on the uptake of organic molecules such as lipid precursors, amino acids and their derivatives, and sugars and their derivatives. Overall, the majority of the transporters identified are more similar to prokaryotic transporters than eukaryotic systems although several instances of the reverse were documented. Taken together, the results support the previous suggestions that the Asgard superphylum includes organisms that are largely mixotrophic and anaerobic but more clearly define their metabolic potential while providing evidence regarding their relatedness to eukaryotes.},

 abstract = {Diverse communities of bacteria colonize plant roots and the rhizosphere. Many of these rhizobacteria are symbionts and provide plant growth promotion (PGP) services, protecting the plant from biotic and abiotic stresses and increasing plant productivity by providing access to nutrients that would otherwise be unavailable to roots. In return, these symbiotic bacteria receive photosynthetically-derived carbon (C), in the form of sugars and organic acids, from plant root exudates. PGP activities have been characterized for a variety of forest tree species and are important in C cycling and sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. The molecular mechanisms of these PGP activities, however, are less well-known. In a previous analysis of Pseudomonas genomes, we found that the bacterial transportome, the aggregate activity of a bacteria's transmembrane transporters, was most predictive for the ecological niche of Pseudomonads in the rhizosphere. Here, we used Populus tremuloides Michx. (trembling aspen) seedlings inoculated with one of three Pseudomonas fluorescens strains (Pf0-1, SBW25, and WH6) and one Pseudomonas protegens (Pf-5) as a laboratory model to further investigate the relationships between the predicted transportomic capacity of a bacterial strain and its observed PGP effects in laboratory cultures. Conditions of low nitrogen (N) or low phosphorus (P) availability and the corresponding replete media conditions were investigated. We measured phenotypic and biochemical parameters of P. tremuloides seedlings and correlated P. fluorescens strain-specific transportomic capacities with P. tremuloides seedling phenotype to predict the strain and nutrient environment-specific transporter functions that lead to experimentally observed, strain, and media-specific PGP activities and the capacity to protect plants against nutrient stress. These predicted transportomic functions fall in three groups: (i) transport of compounds that modulate aspen seedling root architecture, (ii) transport of compounds that help to mobilize nutrients for aspen roots, and (iii) transporters that enable bacterial acquisition of C sources from seedling root exudates. These predictions point to specific molecular mechanisms of PGP activities that can be directly tested through future, hypothesis-driven biological experiments.},

 abstract = {Escherichia coli is a genetically diverse species infecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide annually. We examined seven well-characterized E.coli pathogens causing urinary tract infections, gastroenteritis, pyelonephritis and haemorrhagic colitis. Their transport proteins were identified and compared with each other and a non-pathogenic E.coli K12 strain to identify transport proteins related to pathogenesis. Each pathogen possesses a unique set of protein secretion systems for export to the cell surface or for injecting effector proteins into host cells. Pathogens have increased numbers of iron siderophore receptors and ABC iron uptake transporters, but the numbers and types of low-affinity secondary iron carriers were uniform in all strains. The presence of outer membrane iron complex receptors and high-affinity ABC iron uptake systems correlated, suggesting co-evolution. Each pathovar encodes a different set of pore-forming toxins and virulence-related outer membrane proteins lacking in K12. Intracellular pathogens proved to have a characteristically distinctive set of nutrient uptake porters, different from those of extracellular pathogens. The results presented in this report provide information about transport systems relevant to various types of E.coli pathogenesis that can be exploited in future basic and applied studies. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Tawfik2020,
 abstract = {Background: The human pancreatic cancer cell line A818-6 can be grown in vitro either as a highly malignant, undifferentiated monolayer (ML) or as three-dimensional (3D) single layer hollow spheres (HS) simulating a benign, highly differentiated, duct-like pancreatic epithelial structure. This characteristic allowing A818-6 cells to switch from one phenotype to another makes these cells a unique system to characterize the cellular and molecular modifications during differentiation on one hand and malignant transformation on the other hand. Ion channels and transport proteins (transportome) have been implicated in malignant transformation. Therefore, the current study aimed to analyse the transportome gene expression profile in the A818-6 cells growing as a monolayer or as hollow spheres. Methods & Results: The study identified the differentially expressed transportome genes in both cellular states of A818-6 using Agilent and Nanostring arrays and some targets were validated via immunoblotting. Additionally, these results were compared to a tissue Affymetrix microarray analysis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients' tissues. The overall transcriptional profile of the ML and HS cells confirmed the formerly described mesenchymal features of ML and epithelial nature of HS which was further verified via high expression of E-cadherin and low expression of vimentin found in HS in comparison to ML. Among the predicted features between HS and ML was the involvement of miRNA-9 in this switch. Importantly, the bioinformatics analysis also revealed substantial number (n = 126) of altered transportome genes. Interestingly, three genes upregulated in PDAC tissue samples (GJB2, GJB5 and SLC38A6) were found to be also upregulated in ML and 3 down-regulated transportome genes (KCNQ1, TRPV6 and SLC4A) were also reduced in ML. Conclusion: This reversible HS/ML in vitro system might help in understanding the pathophysiological impact of the transportome in the dedifferentiation process in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the HS/ML model represents a novel system for studying the role of the transportome during the switch from a more benign, differentiated (HS) to a highly malignant, undifferentiated (ML) phenotype.},

 abstract = {Synthetic biology enables the production of small molecules by recombinant microbes for pharma, food, and materials applications. The secretion of products reduces the cost of separation and purification, but it is challenging to engineer due to the limited understanding of the transporter proteins' functions. Here we describe a method for genome-wide transporter disruption that, in combination with a metabolite biosensor, enables the identification of transporters impacting the production of a given target metabolite in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We applied the method to study the transport of xenobiotic compounds, cis,cis-muconic acid (CCM), protocatechuic acid (PCA), and betaxanthins. We found 22 transporters that influenced the production of CCM or PCA. The transporter of the 12-spanner drug:H(+) antiporter (DHA1) family Tpo2p was further confirmed to import CCM and PCA in Xenopus expression assays. We also identified three transporter proteins (Qdr1p, Qdr2p, and Apl1p) involved in betaxanthins transport. In summary, the described method enables high-throughput transporter identification for small molecules in cell factories.},

Bacteroides species make up a significant fraction of the human gut microbiome, and can be probiotic and pathogenic, depending upon various genetic and environmental factors. These can cause disease conditions such as intra-abdominal sepsis, appendicitis, bacteremia, endocarditis, pericarditis, skin infections, brain abscesses and meningitis. In this study, we identify the transport systems and predict their substrates within seven Bacteroides species, all shown to be probiotic; however, four of them (B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. ovatus, B. fragilis) can be pathogenic (probiotic and pathogenic; PAP), while B. cellulosilyticus, B. salanitronis and B. dorei are believed to play only probiotic roles (only probiotic; OP). The transport system characteristics of the four PAP and three OP strains were identified and tabulated, and results were compared among the seven strains, and with E. coli and Salmonella strains. The Bacteroides strains studied contain similarities and differences in the numbers and types of transport proteins tabulated, but both OP and PAP strains contain similar outer membrane carbohydrate receptors, pore-forming toxins and protein secretion systems, the similarities were noteworthy, but these Bacteroides strains showed striking differences with probiotic and pathogenic enteric bacteria, particularly with respect to their high affinity outer membrane receptors and auxiliary proteins involved in complex carbohydrate utilization. The results reveal striking similarities between the PAP and OP species of Bacteroides, and suggest that OP species may possess currently unrecognized pathogenic potential.},

 abstract = {The genus Lactobacillus includes species that may inhabit different anatomical locations in the human body, but the greatest percentage of its species are inhabitants of the gut. Lactobacilli are well known for their probiotic characteristics, although some species may become pathogenic and exert negative effects on human health. The transportome of an organism consists of the sum of the transport proteins encoded within its genome, and studies on the transportome help in the understanding of the various physiological processes taking place in the cell. In this communication we analyze the transport proteins and predict probable substrate specificities of ten Lactobacillus strains. Six of these strains (L. brevis, L. bulgaricus, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. reuteri, and L. ruminis) are currently believed to be only probiotic (OP). The remaining four strains (L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, L. planatarum, and L. rhamnosus) can play dual roles, being both probiotic and pathogenic (PAP). The characteristics of the transport systems found in these bacteria were compared with strains (E. coli, Salmonella, and Bacteroides) from our previous studies. Overall, the ten lactobacilli contain high numbers of amino acid transporters, but the PAP strains contain higher number of sugar, amino acid and peptide transporters as well as drug exporters than their OP counterparts. Moreover, some of the OP strains contain pore-forming toxins and drug exporters similar to those of the PAP strains, thus indicative of yet unrecognized pathogenic potential. The transportomes of the lactobacilli seem to be finely tuned according to the extracellular and probiotic lifestyles of these organisms. Taken together, the results of this study help to reveal the physiological and pathogenic potential of common prokaryotic residents in the human body.},

 abstract = {The human microbiome influences human health in both negative and positive ways. Studies on the transportomes of these organisms yield information that may be utilized for various purposes, including the identification of novel drug targets and the manufacture of improved probiotic strains. Moreover, these genomic analyses help to improve our understanding of the physiology and metabolic capabilities of these organisms. The present study is a continuation of our studies on the transport proteins of the major gut microbes. Bifidobacterium species are essential members of the human gut microbiome, and they initiate colonization of the gut at birth, providing health benefits that last a lifetime. In this study we analyze the transportomes of nine bifidobacterial species: B. adolescentis, B. animalis, B. bifidum, B. breve, B. catenulatum, B. dentium, B. longum subsp. infantis, B. longum subsp. longum, and B. pseudocatenulatum. All of these species have proven probiotic characteristics and exert beneficial effects on human health. Surprisingly, we found that all nine of these species have similar pore-forming toxins and drug exporters that may play roles in pathogenesis. These species have transporters for amino acids, carbohydrates, and proteins, essential for their organismal lifestyles and adaption to their respective ecological niches. The strictly probiotic species, B. bifidum, however, contains fewer such transporters, thus indicative of limited interactions with host cells and other gut microbial counterparts. The results of this study were compared with those of our previous studies on the transportomes of multiple species of Bacteroides, Escherichia coli/Salmonella, and Lactobacillus. Overall, bifidobacteria have larger transportomes (based on percentages of total proteins) than the previously examined groups of bacterial species, with a preference for primary active transport systems over secondary carriers. Taken together, these results provide useful information about the physiologies and pathogenic potentials of these probiotic organisms as reflected by their transportomes.},

 abstract = {Transport of signaling molecules is of major importance for regulating plant growth, development, and responses to the environment. A prime example is the spatial-distribution of auxin, which is regulated via transporters to govern developmental patterning. A critical limitation in our ability to identify transporters by forward genetic screens is their potential functional redundancy. Here, we overcome part of this functional redundancy via a transportome, multi-targeted forward-genetic screen using artificial-microRNAs (amiRNAs). We generate a library of 3000 plant lines expressing 1777 amiRNAs, designed to target closely homologous genes within subclades of transporter families and identify, genotype and quantitatively phenotype, 80 lines showing reproducible shoot growth phenotypes. Within this population, we discover and characterize a strong redundant role for the unstudied ABCB6 and ABCB20 genes in auxin transport and response. The unique multi-targeted lines generated in this study could serve as a genetic resource that is expected to reveal additional transporters.},

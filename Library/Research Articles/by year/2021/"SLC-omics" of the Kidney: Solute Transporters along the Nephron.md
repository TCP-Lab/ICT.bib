### Abstract

The fluid in the 14 distinct segments of the renal tubule undergoes sequential transport processes that gradually convert the glomerular filtrate into the final urine. The solute carrier (SLC) family of proteins is responsible for much of the transport of ions and organic molecules along the renal tubule. In addition, some SLC family proteins mediate housekeeping functions by transporting substrates for metabolism. Here, we have developed a curated list of SLC family proteins. We used the list to produce resource webpages that map these proteins and their transcripts to specific segments along the renal tubule. The data were used to highlight some interesting features of expression along the renal tubule including sex-specific expression in the proximal tubule and the role of accessory proteins ($Î²$-subunit proteins) that are thought to be important for polarized targeting in renal tubule epithelia. Also, as an example of application of the data resource, we describe the patterns of acid-base transporter expression along the renal tubule.

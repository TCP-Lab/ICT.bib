 abstract = {Background: The pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis (L. stagnalis) has been widely used as a model organism in neurobiology, ecotoxicology, and parasitology due to the relative simplicity of its central nervous system (CNS). However, its usefulness is restricted by a limited availability of transcriptome data. While sequence information for the L. stagnalis CNS transcripts has been obtained from EST libraries and a de novo RNA-seq assembly, the quality of these assemblies is limited by a combination of low coverage of EST libraries, the fragmented nature of de novo assemblies, and lack of reference genome. Results: In this study, taking advantage of the recent availability of a preliminary L. stagnalis genome, we generated an RNA-seq library from the adult L. stagnalis CNS, using a combination of genome-guided and de novo assembly programs to identify 17,832 protein-coding L. stagnalis transcripts. We combined our library with existing resources to produce a transcript set with greater sequence length, completeness, and diversity than previously available ones. Using our assembly and functional domain analysis, we profiled L. stagnalis CNS transcripts encoding ion channels and ionotropic receptors, which are key proteins for CNS function, and compared their sequences to other vertebrate and invertebrate model organisms. Interestingly, L. stagnalis transcripts encoding numerous putative Ca2+ channels showed the most sequence similarity to those of Mus musculus, Danio rerio, Xenopus tropicalis, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that many calcium channel-related signaling pathways may be evolutionarily conserved. Conclusions: Our study provides the most thorough characterization to date of the L. stagnalis transcriptome and provides insights into differences between vertebrates and invertebrates in CNS transcript diversity, according to function and protein class. Furthermore, this study provides a complete characterization of the ion channels of Lymnaea stagnalis, opening new avenues for future research on fundamental neurobiological processes in this model system.},

 abstract = {The anal papillae of mosquito larvae are osmoregulatory organs in direct contact with the external aquatic environment that actively sequester ions and take up water in dilute freshwater. In the disease vector Aedes aegypti mechanisms of ion, water and ammonia transport have only been partially resolved. Furthermore, A. aegypti larvae are known to reside in high ammonia sewage and high salt brackish waters, and understanding of anal papillae function in these conditions is in its infancy. The objective of this study was to identify the complement of ion and water transport genes expressed by the anal papillae of freshwater larvae by sequencing their transcriptome, and comparing their expression in anal papillae of larvae abruptly transferred to brackish water for 24 h. Results identified a number of ion and water transport proteins, ammonia detoxifying enzymes, a full suite of xenobiotic detoxifying enzymes and transporters, and G-protein coupled receptors of specific hormones. We identified a marked increase in transcript and protein abundance of aquaporin AaAQP2 in the anal papillae with abrupt transfer to brackish water. We present an updated and more comprehensive model for ion and water transport with additional putative transporters for Na+ and Cl- uptake in the anal papillae. These are organs which are actively engaged in Na+, Cl- and water uptake and regulation when the aquatic larvae encounter fluctuating salinities over the course of their development. Furthermore the transcriptome of the anal papillae includes a full set of xenobiotic detoxification genes suggesting that these are important detoxification organs which is particularly important when larvae reside in polluted water.},

 abstract = {The fluid in the 14 distinct segments of the renal tubule undergoes sequential transport processes that gradually convert the glomerular filtrate into the final urine. The solute carrier (SLC) family of proteins is responsible for much of the transport of ions and organic molecules along the renal tubule. In addition, some SLC family proteins mediate housekeeping functions by transporting substrates for metabolism. Here, we have developed a curated list of SLC family proteins. We used the list to produce resource webpages that map these proteins and their transcripts to specific segments along the renal tubule. The data were used to highlight some interesting features of expression along the renal tubule including sex-specific expression in the proximal tubule and the role of accessory proteins ($β$-subunit proteins) that are thought to be important for polarized targeting in renal tubule epithelia. Also, as an example of application of the data resource, we describe the patterns of acid-base transporter expression along the renal tubule.},

 abstract = {Chinese mitten crab (CMC) or Eriocheir sinensis is a strong osmoregulator that can keep rigorous cellular homeostasis. CMC can flourish in freshwater, as well as seawater, habitats and represents the most important species for freshwater aquaculture. Salt stress can have direct effects on several stages (e.g., reproduction, molting, growth, etc.) of the CMC life cycle. To get a better overview of the genes involved in the gills of CMC under different salinity conditions, we conducted an RNA-Seq meta-analysis on the transcriptomes of four publicly available datasets. The meta-analysis identified 405 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs), of which 40% were classified into various transporter classes, including accessory factors and primary active transporters as the major transport classes. A network analysis of the DETs revealed that adaptation to salinity is a highly regulated mechanism in which different functional modules play essential roles. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to conduct a transcriptome meta-analysis of gills from crab RNA-Seq datasets under salinity. Additionally, this study is also the first to focus on the differential expression of diverse transporters and channels (transportome) in CMC. Our meta-analysis opens new avenues for a better understanding of the osmoregulation mechanism and the selection of potential transporters associated with salinity change.},

 abstract = {Chondrogenic progenitor cells (CPCs) may be used as an alternative source of cells with potentially superior chondrogenic potential compared to mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and could be exploited for future regenerative therapies targeting articular cartilage in degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis (OA). In this study, we hypothesised that CPCs derived from OA cartilage may be characterised by a distinct channelome. First, a global transcriptomic analysis using Affymetrix microarrays was performed. We studied the profiles of those ion channels and transporter families that may be relevant to chondroprogenitor cell physiology. Following validation of the microarray data with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we examined the role of calcium-dependent potassium channels in CPCs and observed functional large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels involved in the maintenance of the chondroprogenitor phenotype. In line with our very recent results, we found that the KCNMA1 gene was upregulated in CPCs and observed currents that could be attributed to the BK channel. The BK channel inhibitor paxilline significantly inhibited proliferation, increased the expression of the osteogenic transcription factor RUNX2, enhanced the migration parameters, and completely abolished spontaneous Ca2+ events in CPCs. Through characterisation of their channelome we demonstrate that CPCs are a distinct cell population but are highly similar to MSCs in many respects. This study adds key mechanistic data to the in-depth characterisation of CPCs and their phenotype in the context of cartilage regeneration.},

 abstract = {The genus Coffea (Rubiaceae) encompasses a group of perennial plant species, including a commodity crop from which seeds are roasted, ground, and infused to make one of the most appreciated beverages in the world. As an important tropical crop restricted to specific regions of the world, coffee production is highly susceptible to the effects of environmental instabilities (i.e., local year-to-year weather fluctuations and global climate change) and threatening pest pressures, not to mention an increasing quality rigor by consumers in industrialized countries. Specialized metabolites are substances that largely affect plant-environment interactions as well as how consumers experience agricultural products. Membrane transporters are key targets, albeit understudied, for understanding and tailoring the spatiotemporal distribution of specialized metabolites as they mediate and control molecular trafficking and substance accumulation. Therefore, we analyzed the transportome of C. canephora encoded within the 25,574 protein-coding genes annotated in the genome of this species and identified 1847 putative membrane transporters. Following, we mined 152 transcriptional profiles of C. canephora and C. arabica and performed a comprehensive co-expression analysis to identify transporters potentially involved in the accumulation of specialized metabolites associated with beverage quality and bioactivity attributes. In toto, this report points to an avenue of possibilities on Coffea genomic and transcriptomic data mining for genetic breeding strategies, which can lead to the development of new, resilient varieties for more sustainable coffee production systems.},

@book{Russum2021,
 abstract = {Upon discovery of the first archaeal species in the 1970s, life has been subdivided into three domains: Eukarya, Archaea, and Bacteria. However, the organization of the three-domain tree of life has been challenged following the discovery of archaeal lineages such as the TACK and Asgard superphyla. The Asgard Superphylum has emerged as the closest archaeal ancestor to eukaryotes, potentially improving our understanding of the evolution of life forms. We characterized the transportomes and their substrates within four metagenome- assembled genomes (MAGs), that is, Odin-, Thor-, Heimdall- and Loki-archaeota as well as the fully sequenced genome of Candidatus Prometheoarchaeum syntrophicum strain MK-D1 that belongs to the Loki phylum. Using the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) as reference, candidate transporters encoded within the proteomes were identified based on sequence similarity, alignment coverage, compatibility of hydropathy profiles, TMS topologies and shared domains. Identified transport systems were compared within the Asgard superphylum as well as within dissimilar eukaryotic, archaeal and bacterial organisms. From these analyses, we infer that Asgard organisms rely mostly on the transport of substrates driven by the proton motive force (pmf), the proton electrochemical gradient which then can be used for ATP production and to drive the activities of secondary carriers. The results indicate that Asgard archaea depend heavily on the uptake of organic molecules such as lipid precursors, amino acids and their derivatives, and sugars and their derivatives. Overall, the majority of the transporters identified are more similar to prokaryotic transporters than eukaryotic systems although several instances of the reverse were documented. Taken together, the results support the previous suggestions that the Asgard superphylum includes organisms that are largely mixotrophic and anaerobic but more clearly define their metabolic potential while providing evidence regarding their relatedness to eukaryotes.},

 abstract = {Synthetic biology enables the production of small molecules by recombinant microbes for pharma, food, and materials applications. The secretion of products reduces the cost of separation and purification, but it is challenging to engineer due to the limited understanding of the transporter proteins' functions. Here we describe a method for genome-wide transporter disruption that, in combination with a metabolite biosensor, enables the identification of transporters impacting the production of a given target metabolite in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We applied the method to study the transport of xenobiotic compounds, cis,cis-muconic acid (CCM), protocatechuic acid (PCA), and betaxanthins. We found 22 transporters that influenced the production of CCM or PCA. The transporter of the 12-spanner drug:H(+) antiporter (DHA1) family Tpo2p was further confirmed to import CCM and PCA in Xenopus expression assays. We also identified three transporter proteins (Qdr1p, Qdr2p, and Apl1p) involved in betaxanthins transport. In summary, the described method enables high-throughput transporter identification for small molecules in cell factories.},

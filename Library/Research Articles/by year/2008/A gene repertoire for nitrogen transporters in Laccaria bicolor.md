### Abstract

• Ectomycorrhizal interactions established between the root systems of terrestrial plants and hyphae from soil-borne fungi are the most ecologically widespread plant symbioses. The efficient uptake of a broad range of nitrogen (N) compounds by the fungal symbiont and their further transfer to the host plant is a major feature of this symbiosis. Nevertheless, we far from understand which N form is preferentially transferred and what are the key molecular determinants required for this transfer. • Exhaustive in silico analysis of N-compound transporter families were performed within the genome of the ectomycorrhizal model fungus Laccaria bicolor. A broad phylogenetic approach was undertaken for all families and gene regulation was investigated using whole-genome expression arrays. • A repertoire of proteins involved in the transport of N compounds in L. bicolor was established that revealed the presence of at least 128 gene models in the genome of L. bicolor. Phylogenetic comparisons with other basidiomycete genomes highlighted the remarkable expansion of some families. Whole-genome expression arrays indicate that 92% of these gene models showed detectable transcript levels. • This work represents a major advance in the establishment of a transportome blueprint at a symbiotic interface, which will guide future experiments.

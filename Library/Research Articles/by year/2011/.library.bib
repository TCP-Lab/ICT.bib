 abstract = {Plant membranes bear a variety of transporters belonging to multigene families that are affected by environmental and nutritional conditions. In addition, they often display high-sequence identity, making difficult in-depth investigation by current shot-gun strategies. In this study, we set up a targeted proteomics approach aimed at identifying and quantifying within single experiments the five major proton pumps of the autoinhibited H+ATPases (AHA) family, the 13 plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIP) water channels (PIPs), and ten members of ammonium transporters (AMTs) and nitrate transporter (NRT) families. Proteotypic peptides were selected and isotopically labeled heavy versions were used for technical optimization and for quantification of the corresponding light version in biological samples. This approach allowed to quantify simultaneously nine PIPs in leaf membranes and 13 PIPs together with three autoinhibited H+ATPases, two ammonium transporters, and two NRTs in root membranes. Similarly, it was used to investigate the effect of a salt stress on the expression of these latter 20 transporters in roots. These novel isoform-specific data were compared with published transcriptome information and revealed a close correlation between PIP isoforms and transcripts levels. The obtained resource is reusable and can be expanded to other transporter families for large-scale profiling of membrane transporters. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

 abstract = {Background. Multidrug resistance (MDR) hampers chemotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). There is little information about MDR mediating drug transporters in HNSCC. Methods. Nine HNSCC cell lines were characterized concerning drug transporter expression and susceptibility to cisplatin, paclitaxel, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) using a DNA microarray and proliferation assays. Three cells lines were precisely investigated for transporter expression using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and drug resistance before and after simulated chemotherapies. Results. The cell lines differed in drug resistance and transporter expression. Cisplatin and paclitaxel resistances were inversely associated. Drugs rendered HNSCC cells resistant, cross-resistant, or cross-sensitive. Sensitivity changes were accompanied by transporter mRNA expression changes. Conclusion. Paclitaxel was identified as a potent inducer of numerous drug transporters and phenotypic MDR in HNSCC. Thus, cytostatic susceptibility of HNSCC cannot exclusively be deduced from the expression of single transporters but more likely of the entire transportome and non-transporter modulators. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

 abstract = {Owing to intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance, the response of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) to chemotherapy is very poor. Here we have investigated the role of transportome in reducing the intracellular content of anticancer drugs and conferring multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. Tumors specimens and paired adjacent tissue were analyzed to determine the MDR signature by TaqMan Low-Density Arrays and single-gene qPCR. Strategies of sensitization were evaluated in vitro using the GAC-derived cell line AGS and in vivo using a subcutaneous xenograft model in immunodeficient nude mice. Several transporters involved in drug uptake and export, which are present in healthy stomach, were highly expressed in GAC. In contrast, the cancer-type OATP1B3 was almost exclusively expressed in tumor tissue. The transportome profile varied depending on tumor anatomical location, differentiation, and stage. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed high MRP1 and MRP4 expression at the plasma membrane of tumor cells as well as AGS cells in culture, in which MRP inhibition resulted in selective sensitization to cytotoxic MRP substrates, such as sorafenib, docetaxel, etoposide, and doxorubicin. In mice with subcutaneous tumors formed by AGS cells, sorafenib alone failed to prevent tumor growth. In contrast, this drug induced a marked inhibitory effect when it was co-administered with diclofenac. In conclusion, MRP1 and MRP4 play an important role in the lack of response of GAC to drugs that are transported by these export pumps. Moreover, agents, such as sorafenib, considered at present useless to treat GAC, may become active antitumor drugs when co-administered with non-toxic MRP inhibitors, such as diclofenac.},

 abstract = {Aims: The mechanisms underlying the fetal origin of renal disease remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the profiles of ion channel and transporter proteins in the fetal kidney in fetal growth restriction (FGR)rats, and to explore their association with the fetal origin of renal disease. Main methods: An FGR rat model was developed by administration of a low-protein diet. Then 367 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) from quantitative proteome analysis were subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. 22 DEPs associated with ion channels/transporters were evaluated in the fetal kidney. Na+/H+ exchanger1(NHE1) and its downstream unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway were investigated. Furthermore, overexpression of NHE1 were achieved via plasmid transfection to evaluate the potential influence on the UPR pathway and cell apoptosis in human proximal tubular epithelial cell line HK2 cells. Key findings: Findings were as follows: 1) In the FGR fetal kidney, aquaporin 2/4, solute carrier (SLC) 8a1, 33a1, etc. were downregulated, whereas other transporters including SLC 2a1, 4a1, 9a1, 29a3, etc. were upregulated. 2) NHE1 mRNA levels were markedly elevated in the FGR fetus. Further investigation revealed an increase in the UPR pathway regulators. 3) In vitro study showed that NHE1 overexpression in HK2 cells significantly induced expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) regulators and led to a decrease in the anti-apoptotic potential. Significance: We speculate that maternal protein malnutrition causes dysregulation of ion channels/transporters in the fetal kidney. Upregulated NHE1 may activate the UPR pathway and induce cell apoptosis thus leading to impairment of kidney function.},

 abstract = {Background: The human pancreatic cancer cell line A818-6 can be grown in vitro either as a highly malignant, undifferentiated monolayer (ML) or as three-dimensional (3D) single layer hollow spheres (HS) simulating a benign, highly differentiated, duct-like pancreatic epithelial structure. This characteristic allowing A818-6 cells to switch from one phenotype to another makes these cells a unique system to characterize the cellular and molecular modifications during differentiation on one hand and malignant transformation on the other hand. Ion channels and transport proteins (transportome) have been implicated in malignant transformation. Therefore, the current study aimed to analyse the transportome gene expression profile in the A818-6 cells growing as a monolayer or as hollow spheres. Methods & Results: The study identified the differentially expressed transportome genes in both cellular states of A818-6 using Agilent and Nanostring arrays and some targets were validated via immunoblotting. Additionally, these results were compared to a tissue Affymetrix microarray analysis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients' tissues. The overall transcriptional profile of the ML and HS cells confirmed the formerly described mesenchymal features of ML and epithelial nature of HS which was further verified via high expression of E-cadherin and low expression of vimentin found in HS in comparison to ML. Among the predicted features between HS and ML was the involvement of miRNA-9 in this switch. Importantly, the bioinformatics analysis also revealed substantial number (n = 126) of altered transportome genes. Interestingly, three genes upregulated in PDAC tissue samples (GJB2, GJB5 and SLC38A6) were found to be also upregulated in ML and 3 down-regulated transportome genes (KCNQ1, TRPV6 and SLC4A) were also reduced in ML. Conclusion: This reversible HS/ML in vitro system might help in understanding the pathophysiological impact of the transportome in the dedifferentiation process in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the HS/ML model represents a novel system for studying the role of the transportome during the switch from a more benign, differentiated (HS) to a highly malignant, undifferentiated (ML) phenotype.},

@article{Zafar2020,
 abstract = {The genus Lactobacillus includes species that may inhabit different anatomical locations in the human body, but the greatest percentage of its species are inhabitants of the gut. Lactobacilli are well known for their probiotic characteristics, although some species may become pathogenic and exert negative effects on human health. The transportome of an organism consists of the sum of the transport proteins encoded within its genome, and studies on the transportome help in the understanding of the various physiological processes taking place in the cell. In this communication we analyze the transport proteins and predict probable substrate specificities of ten Lactobacillus strains. Six of these strains (L. brevis, L. bulgaricus, L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. reuteri, and L. ruminis) are currently believed to be only probiotic (OP). The remaining four strains (L. acidophilus, L. paracasei, L. planatarum, and L. rhamnosus) can play dual roles, being both probiotic and pathogenic (PAP). The characteristics of the transport systems found in these bacteria were compared with strains (E. coli, Salmonella, and Bacteroides) from our previous studies. Overall, the ten lactobacilli contain high numbers of amino acid transporters, but the PAP strains contain higher number of sugar, amino acid and peptide transporters as well as drug exporters than their OP counterparts. Moreover, some of the OP strains contain pore-forming toxins and drug exporters similar to those of the PAP strains, thus indicative of yet unrecognized pathogenic potential. The transportomes of the lactobacilli seem to be finely tuned according to the extracellular and probiotic lifestyles of these organisms. Taken together, the results of this study help to reveal the physiological and pathogenic potential of common prokaryotic residents in the human body.},

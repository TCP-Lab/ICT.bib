 abstract = {The anal papillae of mosquito larvae are osmoregulatory organs in direct contact with the external aquatic environment that actively sequester ions and take up water in dilute freshwater. In the disease vector Aedes aegypti mechanisms of ion, water and ammonia transport have only been partially resolved. Furthermore, A. aegypti larvae are known to reside in high ammonia sewage and high salt brackish waters, and understanding of anal papillae function in these conditions is in its infancy. The objective of this study was to identify the complement of ion and water transport genes expressed by the anal papillae of freshwater larvae by sequencing their transcriptome, and comparing their expression in anal papillae of larvae abruptly transferred to brackish water for 24 h. Results identified a number of ion and water transport proteins, ammonia detoxifying enzymes, a full suite of xenobiotic detoxifying enzymes and transporters, and G-protein coupled receptors of specific hormones. We identified a marked increase in transcript and protein abundance of aquaporin AaAQP2 in the anal papillae with abrupt transfer to brackish water. We present an updated and more comprehensive model for ion and water transport with additional putative transporters for Na+ and Cl- uptake in the anal papillae. These are organs which are actively engaged in Na+, Cl- and water uptake and regulation when the aquatic larvae encounter fluctuating salinities over the course of their development. Furthermore the transcriptome of the anal papillae includes a full set of xenobiotic detoxification genes suggesting that these are important detoxification organs which is particularly important when larvae reside in polluted water.},

@article{lewisSLComicsKidneySolute2021,
 abstract = {The fluid in the 14 distinct segments of the renal tubule undergoes sequential transport processes that gradually convert the glomerular filtrate into the final urine. The solute carrier (SLC) family of proteins is responsible for much of the transport of ions and organic molecules along the renal tubule. In addition, some SLC family proteins mediate housekeeping functions by transporting substrates for metabolism. Here, we have developed a curated list of SLC family proteins. We used the list to produce resource webpages that map these proteins and their transcripts to specific segments along the renal tubule. The data were used to highlight some interesting features of expression along the renal tubule including sex-specific expression in the proximal tubule and the role of accessory proteins ($β$-subunit proteins) that are thought to be important for polarized targeting in renal tubule epithelia. Also, as an example of application of the data resource, we describe the patterns of acid-base transporter expression along the renal tubule.},

@article{Malik2021,
 abstract = {Chinese mitten crab (CMC) or Eriocheir sinensis is a strong osmoregulator that can keep rigorous cellular homeostasis. CMC can flourish in freshwater, as well as seawater, habitats and represents the most important species for freshwater aquaculture. Salt stress can have direct effects on several stages (e.g., reproduction, molting, growth, etc.) of the CMC life cycle. To get a better overview of the genes involved in the gills of CMC under different salinity conditions, we conducted an RNA-Seq meta-analysis on the transcriptomes of four publicly available datasets. The meta-analysis identified 405 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs), of which 40% were classified into various transporter classes, including accessory factors and primary active transporters as the major transport classes. A network analysis of the DETs revealed that adaptation to salinity is a highly regulated mechanism in which different functional modules play essential roles. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to conduct a transcriptome meta-analysis of gills from crab RNA-Seq datasets under salinity. Additionally, this study is also the first to focus on the differential expression of diverse transporters and channels (transportome) in CMC. Our meta-analysis opens new avenues for a better understanding of the osmoregulation mechanism and the selection of potential transporters associated with salinity change.},

@article{thi-kimvuStemCellsFluid2015,
 abstract = {Cystic kidney diseases (CKDs) affect millions of people worldwide. The defining pathological features are fluid-filled cysts developing from nephric tubules due to defective flow sensing, cell proliferation and differentiation. The underlying molecular mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood, and the derived excretory systems of established invertebrate models (Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) are unsuitable to model CKDs. Systematic structure/function comparisons revealed that the combination of ultrafiltration and flow-associated filtrate modification that is central to CKD etiology is remarkably conserved between the planarian excretory system and the vertebrate nephron. Consistently, both RNA-mediated genetic interference (RNAi) of planarian orthologues of human CKD genes and inhibition of tubule flow led to tubular cystogenesis that share many features with vertebrate CKDs, suggesting deep mechanistic conservation. Our results demonstrate a common evolutionary origin of animal excretory systems and establish planarians as a novel and experimentally accessible invertebrate model for the study of human kidney pathologies.},

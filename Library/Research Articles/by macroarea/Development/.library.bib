 abstract = {During morphogenesis, cells communicate with each other to shape tissues and organs. Several lines of recent evidence indicate that ion channels play a key role in cellular signaling and tissue morphogenesis. However, little is known about the scope of specific ion-channel types that impinge upon developmental pathways. The Drosophila melanogaster wing is an excellent model in which to address this problem as wing vein patterning is acutely sensitive to changes in developmental pathways. We conducted a screen of 180 ion channels expressed in the wing using loss-of-function mutant and RNAi lines. Here we identify 44 candidates that significantly impacted development of the Drosophila melanogaster wing. Calcium, sodium, potassium, chloride, and ligand-gated cation channels were all identified in our screen, suggesting that a wide variety of ion channel types are important for development. Ion channels belonging to the pickpocket family, the ionotropic receptor family, and the bestrophin family were highly represented among the candidates of our screen. Seven new ion channels with human orthologs that have been implicated in human channelopathies were also identified. Many of the human orthologs of the channels identified in our screen are targets of common general anesthetics, anti-seizure and anti-hypertension drugs, as well as alcohol and nicotine. Our results confirm the importance of ion channels in morphogenesis and identify a number of ion channels that will provide the basis for future studies to understand the role of ion channels in development.},

 abstract = {Aims: The mechanisms underlying the fetal origin of renal disease remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the profiles of ion channel and transporter proteins in the fetal kidney in fetal growth restriction (FGR)rats, and to explore their association with the fetal origin of renal disease. Main methods: An FGR rat model was developed by administration of a low-protein diet. Then 367 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) from quantitative proteome analysis were subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. 22 DEPs associated with ion channels/transporters were evaluated in the fetal kidney. Na+/H+ exchanger1(NHE1) and its downstream unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway were investigated. Furthermore, overexpression of NHE1 were achieved via plasmid transfection to evaluate the potential influence on the UPR pathway and cell apoptosis in human proximal tubular epithelial cell line HK2 cells. Key findings: Findings were as follows: 1) In the FGR fetal kidney, aquaporin 2/4, solute carrier (SLC) 8a1, 33a1, etc. were downregulated, whereas other transporters including SLC 2a1, 4a1, 9a1, 29a3, etc. were upregulated. 2) NHE1 mRNA levels were markedly elevated in the FGR fetus. Further investigation revealed an increase in the UPR pathway regulators. 3) In vitro study showed that NHE1 overexpression in HK2 cells significantly induced expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) regulators and led to a decrease in the anti-apoptotic potential. Significance: We speculate that maternal protein malnutrition causes dysregulation of ion channels/transporters in the fetal kidney. Upregulated NHE1 may activate the UPR pathway and induce cell apoptosis thus leading to impairment of kidney function.},

@article{Li2005,
 abstract = {This study characterized functional ion channels in cultured undifferentiated human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from bone marrow with whole-cell patch clamp and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques. Three types of outward currents were found in hMSCs, including a noise-like rapidly activating outward current inhibited by the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel (IKCa) blocker iberiotoxin, a transient outward K+ current (Ito) suppressed by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), and a delayed rectifier K+ current (IKDR)-like ether-à-go-go (eag) K+ channel. In addition, tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium current (INa.TTX) and nifedipine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ current (ICa.L) were also detected in 29% and 15% hMSCs, respectively. Moreover, RT-PCR revealed the molecular evidence of high levels of mRNA for the functional ionic currents, including human MaxiK for IKCa, Kv4.2 and Kv1.4 for Ito, heag1 for IKDR, hNE-Na for INa.TTX, and CACNAIC for I Ca.L. These results demonstrate that multiple functional ion channel currents-that is, IKca, Ito heag1, INa.TTX, and ICa.L-are expressed in hMSCs from bone marrow.},

 abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow are believed to be an ideal cell source for cardiomyoplasty; however, cellular electrophysiology is not understood. The present study was designed to investigate ion channels in undifferentiated rat MSCs. It was found that three types of outward currents were present in rat MSCs, including a small portion of Ca2+-activated K+ channel (IKCa) sensitive to inhibition by iberiotoxin and/or clotromazole, a delayed rectifier K+ current (IKDR), and a transient outward K+ current (Ito). In addition, tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive sodium current (INa.TTX) and nifedipine-sensitive L-type Ca2+ current (ICa.L) were found in a small population of rat MSCs. Moreover, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed the molecular evidence of mRNA for the functional ionic currents, including Slo and KCNN4 for IKCa; Kv1.4 for Ito; Kv1.2 and Kv2.1 for IKDR; SCN2a1 for INa.TTX; and CCHL2a for ICa.L. These results demonstrate for the first time that multiple functional ion channel currents (i.e., IKCa, Ito, IKDR, INa.TTX, and ICa.L) are present in rat MSCs from bone marrow; however, physiological roles of these ion channels remain to be studied.},

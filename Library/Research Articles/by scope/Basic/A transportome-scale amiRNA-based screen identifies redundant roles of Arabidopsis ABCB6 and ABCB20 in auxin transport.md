### Abstract

Transport of signaling molecules is of major importance for regulating plant growth, development, and responses to the environment. A prime example is the spatial-distribution of auxin, which is regulated via transporters to govern developmental patterning. A critical limitation in our ability to identify transporters by forward genetic screens is their potential functional redundancy. Here, we overcome part of this functional redundancy via a transportome, multi-targeted forward-genetic screen using artificial-microRNAs (amiRNAs). We generate a library of 3000 plant lines expressing 1777 amiRNAs, designed to target closely homologous genes within subclades of transporter families and identify, genotype and quantitatively phenotype, 80 lines showing reproducible shoot growth phenotypes. Within this population, we discover and characterize a strong redundant role for the unstudied ABCB6 and ABCB20 genes in auxin transport and response. The unique multi-targeted lines generated in this study could serve as a genetic resource that is expected to reveal additional transporters.

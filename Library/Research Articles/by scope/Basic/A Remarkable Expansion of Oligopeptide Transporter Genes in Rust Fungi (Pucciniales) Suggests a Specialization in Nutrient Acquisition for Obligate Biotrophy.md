### Abstract

Nutrient acquisition by rust fungi during their biotrophic growth has been assigned to a few transporters expressed in haustorial infection structures. We performed a comparative genomic analysis of all transporter genes (hereafter termed transportome) classified according to the Transporter Classification Database, focusing specifically on rust fungi (order Pucciniales) versus other species in the Dikarya. We also surveyed expression of transporter genes in the poplar rust fungus for which transcriptomics data are available across the whole life cycle. Despite a significant increase in gene number, rust fungi presented a reduced transportome compared with most fungi in the Dikarya. However, a few transporter families in the subclass Porters showed significant expansions. Notably, three metal transport-related families involved in the import, export, and sequestration of metals were expanded in Pucciniales and expressed at various stages of the rust life cycle, suggesting a tight regulation of metal homeostasis. The most remarkable gene expansion in the Pucciniales was observed for the oligopeptide transporter (OPT) family, with 25 genes on average compared with seven to 14 genes in the other surveyed taxonomical ranks. A phylogenetic analysis showed several specific expansion events at the root of the order Pucciniales with subsequent expansions in rust taxonomical families. The OPT genes showed dynamic expression patterns along the rust life cycle and more particularly during infection of the poplar host tree, suggesting a possible specialization for the acquisition of nitrogen and sulfur through the transport of oligopeptides from the host during biotrophic growth.

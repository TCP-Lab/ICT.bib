 abstract = {Owing to intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance, the response of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) to chemotherapy is very poor. Here we have investigated the role of transportome in reducing the intracellular content of anticancer drugs and conferring multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. Tumors specimens and paired adjacent tissue were analyzed to determine the MDR signature by TaqMan Low-Density Arrays and single-gene qPCR. Strategies of sensitization were evaluated in vitro using the GAC-derived cell line AGS and in vivo using a subcutaneous xenograft model in immunodeficient nude mice. Several transporters involved in drug uptake and export, which are present in healthy stomach, were highly expressed in GAC. In contrast, the cancer-type OATP1B3 was almost exclusively expressed in tumor tissue. The transportome profile varied depending on tumor anatomical location, differentiation, and stage. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed high MRP1 and MRP4 expression at the plasma membrane of tumor cells as well as AGS cells in culture, in which MRP inhibition resulted in selective sensitization to cytotoxic MRP substrates, such as sorafenib, docetaxel, etoposide, and doxorubicin. In mice with subcutaneous tumors formed by AGS cells, sorafenib alone failed to prevent tumor growth. In contrast, this drug induced a marked inhibitory effect when it was co-administered with diclofenac. In conclusion, MRP1 and MRP4 play an important role in the lack of response of GAC to drugs that are transported by these export pumps. Moreover, agents, such as sorafenib, considered at present useless to treat GAC, may become active antitumor drugs when co-administered with non-toxic MRP inhibitors, such as diclofenac.},

We determined the constitutive expression levels of 96 genes, whose encoded proteins contribute to drug action, and identified a major gene network that contains broad selectivity nucleoside transporter genes, as well as several genes known to be involved in cell proliferation and survival. All cell lines were exposed to 5′-DFUR, 5-FU, gemcitabine, cisplatin, doxorubicin and paclitaxel for 48 h and cell response was measured using MTT assays. We correlated the cell response of the fifteen cell lines with the mRNA expression of the selected 96 genes and identified sets of 4–5 genes whose expression profiles correlated to responsiveness to each anticancer drug. These genes may be good candidates as response predictors to such therapies.},

 abstract = {Membrane transporters and channels (collectively the transportome) govern cellular influx and efflux of ions, nutrients, and drugs. We used oligonucleotide arrays to analyze gene expression of the transportome in 60 human cancer cell lines used by the National Cancer Institute for drug screening. Correlating gene expression with the potencies of 119 standard anticancer drugs identified known drug-transporter interactions and suggested novel ones. Folate, nucleoside, and amino acid transporters positively correlated with chemosensitivity to their respective drug substrates. We validated the positive correlation between SLC29A1 (nucleoside transporter ENT1) expression and potency of nucleoside analogues, azacytidine and inosine-glycodialdehyde. Application of an inhibitor of SLC29A1, nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside, significantly reduced the potency of these two drugs, indicating that SLC29A1 plays a role in cellular uptake. Three ABC efflux transporters (ABCB1, ABCC3, and ABCB5) showed significant negative correlations with multiple drugs, suggesting a mechanism of drug resistance. ABCB1 expression correlated negatively with potencies of 19 known ABCB1 substrates and with Baker's antifol and geldanamycin. Use of RNA interference reduced ABCB1 mRNA levels and concomitantly increased sensitivity to these two drugs, as expected for ABCB1 substrates. Similarly, specific silencing of ABCB5 by small interfering RNA increased sensitivity to several drugs in melanoma cells, implicating ABCB5 as a novel chemoresistance factor. Ion exchangers, ion channels, and subunits of proton and sodium pumps variably correlated with drug potency. This study identifies numerous potential drug-transporter relationships and supports a prominent role for membrane transport in determining chemosensitivity. Measurement of transporter gene expression may prove useful in predicting anticancer drug response.},

 abstract = {Background: Ion channels play a critical role in a wide variety of biological processes, including the development of human cancer. However, the overall impact of ion channels on tumorigenicity in breast cancer remains controversial.Methods: We conduct microarray meta-analysis on 280 ion channel genes. We identify candidate ion channels that are implicated in breast cancer based on gene expression profiling. We test the relationship between the expression of ion channel genes and p53 mutation status, ER status, and histological tumor grade in the discovery cohort. A molecular signature consisting of ion channel genes (IC30) is identified by Spearman's rank correlation test conducted between tumor grade and gene expression. A risk scoring system is developed based on IC30. We test the prognostic power of IC30 in the discovery and seven validation cohorts by both Cox proportional hazard regression and log-rank test.Results: 22, 24, and 30 ion channel genes are found to be differentially expressed with a change in p53 mutation status, ER status, and tumor histological grade in the discovery cohort. We assign the 30 tumor grade associated ion channel genes as the IC30 gene signature. We find that IC30 risk score predicts clinical outcome (P < 0.05) in the discovery cohort and 6 out of 7 validation cohorts. Multivariate and univariate tests conducted in two validation cohorts indicate that IC30 is a robust prognostic biomarker, which is independent of standard clinical and pathological prognostic factors including patient age, lymph node status, tumor size, tumor grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor status, and p53 mutation status.Conclusions: We identified a molecular gene signature IC30, which represents a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in breast cancer. Our results indicate that information regarding the expression of ion channels in tumor pathology could provide new targets for therapy in human cancers. © 2013 Ko et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

 abstract = {Ion channels are known to regulate cancer processes at all stages. The roles of ion channels in cancer pathology are extremely diverse. We systematically analyzed the expression patterns of ion channel genes in lung adenocarcinoma. First, we compared the expression of ion channel genes between normal and tumor tissues in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Thirty-seven ion channel genes were identified as being differentially expressed between the two groups. Next, we investigated the prognostic power of ion channel genes in lung adenocarcinoma. We assigned a risk score to each lung adenocarcinoma patient based on the expression of the differentially expressed ion channel genes. We demonstrated that the risk score effectively predicted overall survival and recurrence-free survival in lung adenocarcinoma. We also found that the risk scores for ever-smokers were higher than those for never-smokers. Multivariate analysis indicated that the risk score was a significant prognostic factor for survival, which is independent of patient age, gender, stage, smoking history, Myc level, and EGFR/KRAS/ALK gene mutation status. Finally, we investigated the difference in ion channel gene expression between the two major subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer: adenocarcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma. Thirty ion channel genes were identified as being differentially expressed between the two groups. We suggest that ion channel gene expression can be used to improve the subtype classification in non-small cell lung cancer at the molecular level. The findings in this study have been validated in several independent lung cancer cohorts. © 2014 Ko et al.},

@article{Marin2014,
 abstract = {A major difficulty in the treatment of cancers is the poor response of many tumors to pharmacological regimens. This situation can be accounted for by the existence of a variety of complex mechanisms of chemoresistance (MOCs), leading to reduced intracellular concentrations of active agents, changes in the molecular targets of the drugs, enhanced repair of drug-induced modifications in macromolecules, stimulation of anti-apoptotic mechanisms, and inhibition of pro-apoptotic mechanisms. The present review focuses on alterations in the expression and appearance of the genetic variants that affect the genes involved in reducing the amount of active agents inside tumor cells. These alterations can occur through two mechanisms: either by lowering uptake or enhancing efflux (so-called MOC-1a and MOC-1b, respectively), or by decreasing the activation of prodrugs or enhancing inactivation of active agents through their biotransformation (MOC-2). The development of chemosensitizers that are useful in implementing the pharmacological manipulation of these processes constitutes a challenge to modern pharmacology. Nevertheless, the important physiological roles of the most relevant genes involved in MOC-1a, MOC-1b, and MOC-2 make it difficult to prevent the side effects of chemosensitizers. A more attainable goal in this area of pharmacological enquiry is the identification of proteomic profiles that will permit oncologists to accurately predict a lack of response to a given regimen, which would be useful for adapting treatment to the personal situation of each patient. © 2013 CPS.},

 abstract = {Ion channels and transporters have increasingly recognized roles in cancer progression through the regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and death. Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) are a source of tumor formation and recurrence in glioblastoma multiforme, a highly aggressive brain cancer, suggesting that ion channel expression may be perturbed in this population. However, little is known about the expression and functional relevance of ion channels that may contribute to GSC malignancy. Using RNA sequencing, we assessed the enrichment of ion channels in GSC isolates and non-tumor neural cell types. We identified a unique set of GSC-enriched ion channels using differential expression analysis that is also associated with distinct gene mutation signatures. In support of potential clinical relevance, expression of selected GSC-enriched ion channels evaluated in human glioblastoma databases of The Cancer Genome Atlas and Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project correlated with patient survival times. Finally, genetic knockdown as well as pharmacological inhibition of individual or classes of GSC-enriched ion channels constrained growth of GSCs compared to normal neural stem cells. This first-in-kind global examination characterizes ion channels enriched in GSCs and explores their potential clinical relevance to glioblastoma molecular subtypes, gene mutations, survival outcomes, regional tumor expression, and experimental responses to loss-of-function. Together, the data support the potential biological and therapeutic impact of ion channels on GSC malignancy and provide strong rationale for further examination of their mechanistic and therapeutic importance.},

@article{Tawfik2020,
 abstract = {Background: The human pancreatic cancer cell line A818-6 can be grown in vitro either as a highly malignant, undifferentiated monolayer (ML) or as three-dimensional (3D) single layer hollow spheres (HS) simulating a benign, highly differentiated, duct-like pancreatic epithelial structure. This characteristic allowing A818-6 cells to switch from one phenotype to another makes these cells a unique system to characterize the cellular and molecular modifications during differentiation on one hand and malignant transformation on the other hand. Ion channels and transport proteins (transportome) have been implicated in malignant transformation. Therefore, the current study aimed to analyse the transportome gene expression profile in the A818-6 cells growing as a monolayer or as hollow spheres. Methods & Results: The study identified the differentially expressed transportome genes in both cellular states of A818-6 using Agilent and Nanostring arrays and some targets were validated via immunoblotting. Additionally, these results were compared to a tissue Affymetrix microarray analysis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients' tissues. The overall transcriptional profile of the ML and HS cells confirmed the formerly described mesenchymal features of ML and epithelial nature of HS which was further verified via high expression of E-cadherin and low expression of vimentin found in HS in comparison to ML. Among the predicted features between HS and ML was the involvement of miRNA-9 in this switch. Importantly, the bioinformatics analysis also revealed substantial number (n = 126) of altered transportome genes. Interestingly, three genes upregulated in PDAC tissue samples (GJB2, GJB5 and SLC38A6) were found to be also upregulated in ML and 3 down-regulated transportome genes (KCNQ1, TRPV6 and SLC4A) were also reduced in ML. Conclusion: This reversible HS/ML in vitro system might help in understanding the pathophysiological impact of the transportome in the dedifferentiation process in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the HS/ML model represents a novel system for studying the role of the transportome during the switch from a more benign, differentiated (HS) to a highly malignant, undifferentiated (ML) phenotype.},

 abstract = {Background. Multidrug resistance (MDR) hampers chemotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). There is little information about MDR mediating drug transporters in HNSCC. Methods. Nine HNSCC cell lines were characterized concerning drug transporter expression and susceptibility to cisplatin, paclitaxel, and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) using a DNA microarray and proliferation assays. Three cells lines were precisely investigated for transporter expression using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and drug resistance before and after simulated chemotherapies. Results. The cell lines differed in drug resistance and transporter expression. Cisplatin and paclitaxel resistances were inversely associated. Drugs rendered HNSCC cells resistant, cross-resistant, or cross-sensitive. Sensitivity changes were accompanied by transporter mRNA expression changes. Conclusion. Paclitaxel was identified as a potent inducer of numerous drug transporters and phenotypic MDR in HNSCC. Thus, cytostatic susceptibility of HNSCC cannot exclusively be deduced from the expression of single transporters but more likely of the entire transportome and non-transporter modulators. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The malfunction and/or aberrant expression of ion channels may disrupt these important biological processes and influence cancer progression. In this study, we investigate the expression pattern of ion channel genes in glioma. We designate 18 ion channel genes that are differentially expressed in high-grade glioma as a prognostic molecular signature. This ion channel gene expression based signature predicts glioma outcome in three independent validation cohorts. Interestingly, 16 of these 18 genes were down-regulated in high-grade glioma. This signature is independent of traditional clinical, molecular, and histological factors. Resampling tests indicate that the prognostic power of the signature outperforms random gene sets selected from human genome in all the validation cohorts. More importantly, this signature performs better than the random gene signatures selected from glioma-associated genes in two out of three validation datasets. This study implicates ion channels in brain cancer, thus expanding on knowledge of their roles in other cancers. Individualized profiling of ion channel gene expression serves as a superior and independent prognostic tool for glioma patients.},

 abstract = {The altered expression and/or activity of ion channels and transporters (transportome) have been associated with malignant behavior of cancer cells and were proposed to be a hallmark of cancer. However, the impact of altered transportome in epithelial cancers, such as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), as well as its pathophysiological consequences, still remains unclear. Here, we report the in silico analysis of 840 transportome genes in PDAC patients' tissues. Our study was focused on the transportome changes and their correlation with functional and behavioral responses in PDAC tumor and stromal compartments. The dysregulated gene expression datasets were filtered using a cut-off of fold-change values ≤−2 or ≥2 (adjusted p value ≤0.05). The dysregulated transportome genes were clearly associated with impaired physiological secretory mechanisms and/or pH regulation, control of cell volume, and cell polarity. Additionally, some down-regulated transportome genes were found to be closely linked to epithelial cell differentiation. Furthermore, the observed decrease in genes coding for calcium and chloride transport might be a mechanism for evasion of apoptosis. In conclusion, the current work provides a comprehensive overview of the altered transportome expression and its association with predicted PDAC malignancy with special focus on the epithelial compartment.},

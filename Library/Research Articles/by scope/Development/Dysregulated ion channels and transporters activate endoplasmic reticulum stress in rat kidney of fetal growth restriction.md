### Abstract

Aims: The mechanisms underlying the fetal origin of renal disease remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the profiles of ion channel and transporter proteins in the fetal kidney in fetal growth restriction (FGR)rats, and to explore their association with the fetal origin of renal disease. Main methods: An FGR rat model was developed by administration of a low-protein diet. Then 367 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) from quantitative proteome analysis were subjected to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. 22 DEPs associated with ion channels/transporters were evaluated in the fetal kidney. Na+/H+ exchanger1(NHE1) and its downstream unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway were investigated. Furthermore, overexpression of NHE1 were achieved via plasmid transfection to evaluate the potential influence on the UPR pathway and cell apoptosis in human proximal tubular epithelial cell line HK2 cells. Key findings: Findings were as follows: 1) In the FGR fetal kidney, aquaporin 2/4, solute carrier (SLC) 8a1, 33a1, etc. were downregulated, whereas other transporters including SLC 2a1, 4a1, 9a1, 29a3, etc. were upregulated. 2) NHE1 mRNA levels were markedly elevated in the FGR fetus. Further investigation revealed an increase in the UPR pathway regulators. 3) In vitro study showed that NHE1 overexpression in HK2 cells significantly induced expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) regulators and led to a decrease in the anti-apoptotic potential. Significance: We speculate that maternal protein malnutrition causes dysregulation of ion channels/transporters in the fetal kidney. Upregulated NHE1 may activate the UPR pathway and induce cell apoptosis thus leading to impairment of kidney function.

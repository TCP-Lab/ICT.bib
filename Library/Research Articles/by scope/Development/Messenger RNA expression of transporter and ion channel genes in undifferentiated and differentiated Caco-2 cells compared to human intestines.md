### Abstract

Purpose. The purpose of this work was to study the influence of cell differentiation on the mRNA expression of transporters and channels in Caco-2 cells and to assess Caco-2 cells as a model for carriermediated drug transport in the intestines. Method. Gene mRNA expression was measured using a custom-designed microarray chip with 750 deoxyoligonucleotide probes (70mers). Each oligomer was printed four times on poly-lysine-coated glass slides. Expression profiles were expressed as ratio values between fluorescence intensities of Cy3 and Cy5 dye-labeled cDNA derived from poly(A) + RNA samples of Caco-2 cells and total RNA of human intestines. Results. Significant differences in the mRNA expression profile of transporters and channels were observed upon differentiation of Caco-2 cells from 5 days to 2 weeks in culture, including changes for MAT8, S-protein, and Nramp2. Comparing Caco-2 cells of different passage number revealed few changes in mRNAs except for GLUT3, which was down-regulated 2.4-fold within 13 passage numbers. Caco-2 cells had a similar expression profile when either cultured in flasks or on filters but differed more strongly from human small and large intestine, regardless of the differentiation state of Caco-2 cells. Expression of several genes highly transcribed in small or large intestines differed fourfold or more in Caco-2 cells. Conclusions. Although Caco-2 cells have proven a suitable model for studying carrier-mediated transport in human intestines, the expression of specific transporter and ion channel genes may differ substantially.

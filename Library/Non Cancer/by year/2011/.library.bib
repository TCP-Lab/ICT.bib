 abstract = {Diarrhoea is a hallmark of intestinal inflammation. The mechanisms operating in acute inflammation of the intestine are well characterized and are related to regulatory changes induced by inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, cytokines or reactive oxygen species, along with leakage due to epithelial injury and changes in permeability. In chronic colitis, however, the mechanisms are less well known, but it is generally accepted that both secretory and absorptive processes are inhibited. These disturbances in ionic transport may be viewed as an adaptation to protracted inflammation of the intestine, since prolonged intense secretion may be physiologically unacceptable in the long term. Mechanistically, the changes in transport may be due to adjustments in the regulation of the different processes involved, to broader epithelial alterations or frank damage, or to modulation of the transportome in terms of expression. In the present review, we offer a summary of the existing evidence on the status of the transportome in chronic intestinal inflammation. {\textcopyright}The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright}2011 Biochemical Society.},

@article{Schulte2011,
 abstract = {There is emerging evidence from functional analyses and molecular research that the role of ion channels in cell physiology is not only determined by the pore-forming subunits but also depends on their molecular environment. Accordingly, the local and temporal specificity of channel-mediated signal transduction is thought to result from association of these integral membrane proteins with distinct sets of partner proteins or from their assembly into stable macromolecular complexes. As yet, however, the molecular environments of most ion channels have escaped direct investigation, mostly because of technical limitations that precluded their comprehensive molecular analysis. Recent advances in proteomic technologies promoted an experimental workflow that combines affinity purification of readily solubilized protein complexes with quantitative high-resolution mass spectrometry and that offers access to channel-associated protein environments. We will discuss advantages and limitations of this proteomic approach, as well as the results obtained from its application to several types of ion channels including Cav channels, Kv channels, HCN channels, AMPA-type glutamate receptors and GABAB receptors. The respective results indicate that the approach provides unbiased and comprehensive information on (i) the subunit composition of channel cores including identification of auxiliary subunits, on (ii) the assembly of channel cores into 'signaling entities' and on (iii) integration of channels into extended protein networks. Thus, quantitative proteomics opens a new window for the investigation of ion channels and their function in the context of various types of cell. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

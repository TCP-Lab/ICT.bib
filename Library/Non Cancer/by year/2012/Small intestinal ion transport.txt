Abstract:
    PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we focus on the recent (March 2010 to September 2011) advances in small intestinal ion transport, with particular emphasis on sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and calcium transport mechanisms under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Knockout of NHERF1 and NHERF2 allowed translation of the data largely derived from the in-vitro models into a living organism. These studies also expand our knowledge about the complexity of intestinal transporter interactomes, define the role for scaffolding proteins in basal and regulated apical transport, and help identify potential targets for pharmacological approaches. We continue to accumulate novel information about the function and regulation of NHE3 (including its role in regulating paracellular Ca flux), NHE8, as well as about the complexity of the intestinal Cl and HCO3 transport in health and disease. SUMMARY: Thanks to the new genetically engineered mouse models, a significant progress has been made in our understanding of the role of NHERF proteins in regulation of intestinal Na absorption. Significant novel data on the coordinated function of bicarbonate, chloride, and sodium transporters contributes to our current views of the integrative physiology of the small intestinal electrolyte transport. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

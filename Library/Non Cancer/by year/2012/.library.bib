 abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we focus on the recent (March 2010 to September 2011) advances in small intestinal ion transport, with particular emphasis on sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and calcium transport mechanisms under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Knockout of NHERF1 and NHERF2 allowed translation of the data largely derived from the in-vitro models into a living organism. These studies also expand our knowledge about the complexity of intestinal transporter interactomes, define the role for scaffolding proteins in basal and regulated apical transport, and help identify potential targets for pharmacological approaches. We continue to accumulate novel information about the function and regulation of NHE3 (including its role in regulating paracellular Ca flux), NHE8, as well as about the complexity of the intestinal Cl and HCO3 transport in health and disease. SUMMARY: Thanks to the new genetically engineered mouse models, a significant progress has been made in our understanding of the role of NHERF proteins in regulation of intestinal Na absorption. Significant novel data on the coordinated function of bicarbonate, chloride, and sodium transporters contributes to our current views of the integrative physiology of the small intestinal electrolyte transport. {\textcopyright} 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

@article{Hedrich2012,
 abstract = {Since the first recordings of single potassium channel activities in the plasma membrane of guard cells more than 25 years ago, patch-clamp studies discovered a variety of ion channels in all cell types and plant species under inspection. Their properties differed in a cell type-and cell membrane-dependent manner. Guard cells, for which the existence of plant potassium channels was initially documented, advanced to a versatile model system for studying plant ion channel structure, function, and physiology. Interestingly, one of the first identified potassium-channel genes encoding the Shaker-type channel KAT1 was shown to be highly expressed in guard cells. KAT1-type channels from Arabidopsis thaliana and its homologs from other species were found to encode the K-selective inward rectifiers that had already been recorded in early patch-clamp studies with guard cells. Within the genome era, additional Arabidopsis Shaker-type channels appeared. All nine members of the Arabidopsis Shaker family are localized at the plasma membrane, where they either operate as inward rectifiers, outward rectifiers, weak voltage-dependent channels, or electrically silent, but modulatory subunits. The vacuole membrane, in contrast, harbors a set of two-pore K channels. Just very recently, two plant anion channel families of the SLAC/SLAH and ALMT/QUAC type were identified. SLAC1/SLAH3 and QUAC1 are expressed in guard cells and mediate Slow-and Rapid-type anion currents, respectively, that are involved in volume and turgor regulation. Anion channels in guard cells and other plant cells are key targets within often complex signaling networks. Here, the present knowledge is reviewed for the plant ion channel biology. Special emphasis is drawn to the molecular mechanisms of channel regulation, in the context of model systems and in the light of evolution. {\textcopyright} 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

@article{Hiroi2012,
 abstract = {Teleost fishes are able to acclimatize to seawater by secreting excess NaCl by means of specialized " ionocytes" in the gill epithelium. Antibodies against Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) have been used since 1996 as a marker for identifying branchial ionocytes. Immunohistochemistry of NKA by itself and in combination with Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter and CFTR Cl- channel provided convincing evidence that ionocytes are functional during seawater acclimation, and also revealed morphological variations in ionocytes among teleost species. Recent development of antibodies to freshwater- and seawater-specific isoforms of the NKA alpha-subunit has allowed functional distinction of ion absorptive and secretory ionocytes in Atlantic salmon. Cutaneous ionocytes of tilapia embryos serve as a model for branchial ionocytes, allowing identification of 4 types: two involved in ion uptake, one responsible for salt secretion and one with unknown function. Combining molecular genetics, advanced imaging techniques and immunohistochemistry will rapidly advance our understanding of both the unity and diversity of ionocyte function and regulation in fish osmoregulation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Cell motility is central to tissue homeostasis in health and disease, and there is hardly any cell in the body that is not motile at a given point in its life cycle. Important physiological processes intimately related to the ability of the respective cells to migrate include embryogenesis, immune defense, angiogenesis, and wound healing. On the other side, migration is associated with life-threatening pathologies such as tumor metastases and atherosclerosis. Research from the last $\sim$ 15 years revealed that ion channels and transporters are indispensable components of the cellular migration apparatus. After presenting general principles by which transport proteins affect cell migration, we will discuss systematically the role of channels and transporters involved in cell migration. {\textcopyright} 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

@article{Shukla2012,
 abstract = {Ion channels regulate the membrane potential and intracellular ionic concentration and thus serve a central role in various cellular processes. Several ion channels have been identified in the germ cells, including sperm, emphasizing their importance in male fertility and reproduction. The molecular mechanism of ion transport and the nature of the ion channels involved have begun to emerge only recently despite the fact that several ligand-gated and voltage-gated channels have been identified and localized on sperm. The presence of the sperm-associated cation channel (CatSper1-4) gene family, proton voltage-gated ion channel (Hv1), potassium voltage-gated ion channel (SLO3/KCNU1), sodium voltage-gated channel (NaV1.1-1.9), and the members of the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family suggest an indispensable role for ion channels in sperm physiology and fertility potential. Ion channels are the key players in very important processes such as capacitation and the acrosome reaction, which are critical steps in sperm physiology preparing for fertilization. For example, CatSper, Hv1, SLO3, and TRP channel family members have been proposed to participate in the acrosome reaction, thereby making them most important for sperm fertility. Similarly, NaV channels could play a crucial role in noncapacitated sperm and in the initial capacitation steps. The role of ion channels seems indispensable for sperm fertility as evidenced by studies on animal models; however, the functional defects in infertile human males await further exploration. This article represents an update on the role of ion channels in sperm physiology, male fertility, and infertility. {\textcopyright} American Society of Andrology.},

@article{Staruschenko2012,
 abstract = {The central goal of this overview article is to summarize recent findings in renal epithelial transport, focusing chiefly on the connecting tubule (CNT) and the cortical collecting duct (CCD).Mammalian CCD and CNT are involved in fine-tuning of electrolyte and fluid balance throughreabsorption and secretion. Specific transporters and channels mediate vectorial movements ofwater and solutes in these segments. Although only a small percent of the glomerular filtratereaches the CNT and CCD, these segments are critical for water and electrolyte homeostasissince several hormones, for example, aldosterone and arginine vasopressin, exert their maineffects in these nephron sites. Importantly, hormones regulate the function of the entire nephronand kidney by affecting channels and transporters in the CNT and CCD. Knowledge about thephysiological and pathophysiological regulation of transport in the CNT and CCD and particularroles of specific channels/transporters has increased tremendously over the last two decades. Recent studies shed new light on several key questions concerning the regulation of renal transport. Precise distribution patterns of transport proteins in the CCD and CNT will be reviewed, andtheir physiological roles and mechanisms mediating ion transport in these segments will also becovered. Special emphasis will be given to pathophysiological conditions appearing as a result of abnormalities in renal transport in the CNT and CCD. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Physiological Society.},

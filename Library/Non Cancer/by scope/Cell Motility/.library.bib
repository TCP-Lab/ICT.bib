 abstract = {Cell migration plays a central role in many physiological and pathophysiological processes, such as embryogenesis, immune defense, wound healing, or the formation of tumor metastases. Detailed models have been developed that describe cytoskeletal mechanisms of cell migration. However, evidence is emerging that ion channels and transporters also play an important role in cell migration. The purpose of this review is to examine the function and subcellular distribution of ion channels and transporters in cell migration. Topics covered will be a brief overview of cytoskeletal mechanisms of migration, the role of ion channels and transporters involved in cell migration, and ways by which a polarized distribution of ion channels and transporters can be achieved in migrating cells. Moreover, a model is proposed that combines ion transport with cytoskeletal mechanisms of migration.},

 abstract = {Cell motility is central to tissue homeostasis in health and disease, and there is hardly any cell in the body that is not motile at a given point in its life cycle. Important physiological processes intimately related to the ability of the respective cells to migrate include embryogenesis, immune defense, angiogenesis, and wound healing. On the other side, migration is associated with life-threatening pathologies such as tumor metastases and atherosclerosis. Research from the last $\sim$ 15 years revealed that ion channels and transporters are indispensable components of the cellular migration apparatus. After presenting general principles by which transport proteins affect cell migration, we will discuss systematically the role of channels and transporters involved in cell migration. {\textcopyright} 2012 the American Physiological Society.},

@article{Stock2013,
 abstract = {Cell motility is an essential feature of life. It is essential for reproduction, propagation, embryonic development, and healing processes such as wound closure and a successful immune defense. If out of control, cell motility can become life-threatening as, for example, in metastasis or autoimmune diseases. Regardless of whether ciliary/flagellar or amoeboid movement, controlled motility always requires a concerted action of ion channels and transporters, cytoskeletal elements, and signaling cascades. Ion transport across the plasma membrane contributes to cell motility by affecting the membrane potential and voltage-sensitive ion channels, by inducing local volume changes with the help of aquaporins and by modulating cytosolic Ca2+ and H+ concentrations. Voltage-sensitive ion channels serve as voltage detectors in electric fields thus enabling galvanotaxis; local swelling facilitates the outgrowth of protrusions at the leading edge while local shrinkage accompanies the retraction of the cell rear; the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration exerts its main effect on cytoskeletal dynamics via motor proteins such as myosin or dynein; and both, the intracellular and the extracellular H2+ concentration modulate cell migration and adhesion by tuning the activity of enzymes and signaling molecules in the cytosol as well as the activation state of adhesion molecules at the cell surface. In addition to the actual process of ion transport, both, channels and transporters contribute to cell migration by being part of focal adhesion complexes and/or physically interacting with components of the cytoskeleton. The present article provides an overview of how the numerous ion-transport mechanisms contribute to the various modes of cell motility. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physiological Society.},

 abstract = {Apoptosis, a type of genetically controlled cell death, is a fundamental cellular mechanism utilized by multicellular organisms for disposal of cells that are no longer needed or potentially detrimental. Given the crucial role of apoptosis in physiology, deregulation of apoptotic machinery is associated with various diseases as well as abnormalities in development. Acquired resistance to apoptosis represents the common feature of most and perhaps all types of cancer. Therefore, repairing and reactivating apoptosis represents a promising strategy to fight cancer. Accumulated evidence identifies ion channels as essential regulators of apoptosis. However, the contribution of specific ion channels to apoptosis varies greatly depending on cell type, ion channel type and intracellular localization, pathology as well as intracellular signaling pathways involved. Here we discuss the involvement of major types of ion channels in apoptosis regulation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane channels and transporters in cancers.},

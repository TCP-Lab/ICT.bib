 abstract = {Head and neck cancers are a highly complex and heterogeneous group of malignancies that involve very diverse anatomical structures and distinct aetiological factors, treatments and clinical outcomes. Among them, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are predominant and the sixth most common cancer worldwide with still low survival rates. Omic technologies have unravelled the intricacies of tumour biology, harbouring a large diversity of genetic and molecular changes to drive the carcinogenesis process. Nonetheless, this remarkable heterogeneity of molecular alterations opens up an immense opportunity to discover novel biomarkers and develop molecular-targeted therapies. Increasing evidence demonstrates that dysregulation of ion channel expression and/or function is frequently and commonly observed in a variety of cancers from different origin. As a consequence, the concept of ion channels as potential membrane therapeutic targets and/or biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis has attracted growing attention. This chapter intends to comprehensively and critically review the current state-of-art ion channel dysregulation specifically focusing on head and neck cancers and to formulate the major challenges and research needs to translate this knowledge into clinical application. Based on current reported data, various voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels (i.e. Kv3.4, Kv10.1 and Kv11.1) have been found frequently aberrantly expressed in HNSCC as well as precancerous lesions and are highlighted as clinically and biologically relevant features in both early stages of tumourigenesis and late stages of disease progression. More importantly, they also emerge as promising candidates as cancer risk markers, tumour markers and potential anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic targets for therapeutic interventions; however, the oncogenic properties seem to be independent of their ion-conducting function.},

 abstract = {Ovarian cancer is associated with limited overall survival, due to problems in early detection and therapy. Membrane ion channels have been proposed to play a significant, concerted role in the cancer process, from initial proliferation to metastasis, and promise to be early, functional biomarkers. We review the evidence for ion channel and aquaporin expression and functioning in human ovarian cancer cells and tissues. In vitro, K+ channels, mainly voltage-gated, including Ca2+-activated channels, have been found to control the cell cycle, as in other cancers. Voltage-gated, volume-regulated and intracellular Cl- channels have been detected in vitro and in vivo and shown to be involved in proliferation, adhesion and invasion. Evidence for 'transient receptor potential', voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, which have been shown to contribute to pathogenesis of other carcinomas, is also emerging in ovarian cancer. Aquaporins may be involved in cell growth, migration and formation of ascites via increased water permeability of micro-vessels. It is concluded that functional expression of ion channels and their regulation by steroid hormones and growth factors are an integral part of ovarian cancer development and progression. Furthermore, ion channels may be involved in multidrug resistance, commonly associated with treatment of ovarian cancer. We propose that ion channel studies can facilitate our understanding of the pathobiology of ovarian cancer and, ultimately, can serve as viable novel targets for its clinical management. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

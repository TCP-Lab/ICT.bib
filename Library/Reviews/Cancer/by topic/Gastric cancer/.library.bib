 abstract = {Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant cancers in the world and has only few treatment options and, concomitantly, a poor prognosis. It is generally accepted now that the tumor microenvironment, particularly that under hypoxia, plays an important role in cancer development. Hypoxia can regulate the energy metabolism and malignancy of tumor cells by inducing or altering various important factors, such as oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), autophagy and acidosis. In addition, altered expression and/or dysfunction of ion channels/transporters (ICTs) have been encountered in a variety of human tumors, including GC, and to play an important role in the processes of tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Increasing evidence indicates that ICTs are at least partly involved in interactions between cancer cells and their hypoxic microenvironment. Here, we provide an overview of the different ICTs that regulate or are regulated by hypoxia in GC. Conclusions and perspectives: Hypoxia is one of the major obstacles to cancer therapy. Regulating cellular responses and factors under hypoxia can inhibit GC. Similarly, altering the expression or activity of ICTs, such as the application of ion channel inhibitors, can slow down the growth and/or migration of GC cells. Since targeting the hypoxic microenvironment and/or ICTs may be a promising strategy for the treatment of GC, more attention should be paid to the interplay between ICTs and the development and progression of GC in such a microenvironment.},

@article{Yuan2020,
 abstract = {Gastric cancer (GC) is a highly invasive and fatal malignant disease that accounts for 5.7% of new global cancer cases and is the third leading cause of cancer-related death. Acid/base homeostasis is critical for organisms because protein and enzyme function, cellular structure, and plasma membrane permeability change with pH. Various ion transporters are expressed in normal gastric mucosal epithelial cells and regulate gastric acid secretion, ion transport, and fluid absorption, thereby stabilizing the differentiation and homeostasis of gastric mucosal epithelial cells. Ion transporter dysfunction results in disordered ion transport, mucosa barrier dysfunction, and acid/base disturbances, causing gastric acid-related diseases such as chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) and GC. This review summarizes the physiological functions of multiple ion transporters and channels in the stomach, including Cl- channels, Cl-/HCO3- exchangers, sodium/hydrogen exchangers (NHEs), and potassium (K+) channels, and their pathophysiological relevance in GC.},

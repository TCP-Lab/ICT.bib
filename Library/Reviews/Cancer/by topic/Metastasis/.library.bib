 abstract = {Cell migration is a central component of the metastatic cascade requiring a concerted action of ion channels and transporters (migration-associated transportome), cytoskeletal elements and signalling cascades. Ion transport proteins and aquaporins contribute to tumour cell migration and invasion among other things by inducing local volume changes and/or by modulating Ca2+ and H+ signalling. Targeting cell migration therapeutically bears great clinical potential, because it is a prerequisite for metastasis. Ion transport proteins appear to be attractive candidate target proteins for this purpose because they are easily accessible as membrane proteins and often overexpressed or activated in cancer. Importantly, a number of clinically widely used drugs are available whose anticipated efficacy as anti-tumour drugs, however, has now only begun to be evaluated. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

@article{Stock2015,
 abstract = {An elaborate interplay between ion channels and transporters, components of the cytoskeleton, adhesion molecules, and signaling cascades provides the basis for each major step of the metastatic cascade. Ion channels and transporters contribute to cell motility by letting through or transporting ions essential for local Ca2 +, pH and - in cooperation with water permeable aquaporins - volume homeostasis. Moreover, in addition to the actual ion transport they, or their auxiliary subunits, can display non-conducting activities. They can exert kinase activity in order to phosphorylate cytoskeletal constituents or their associates. They can become part of signaling processes by permeating Ca2 +, by generating local pH-nanodomains or by being final downstream effectors. A number of channels and transporters are found at focal adhesions, interacting directly or indirectly with proteins of the extracellular matrix, with integrins or with components of the cytoskeleton. We also include the role of aquaporins in cell motility. They drive the outgrowth of lamellipodia/invadopodia or control the number of $β$1 integrins in the plasma membrane. The multitude of interacting ion channels and transporters (called transportome) including the associated signaling events holds great potential as therapeutic target(s) for anticancer agents that are aimed at preventing metastasis.

@article{Stock2022,
 abstract = {Survival in the circulation, extravasation from vasculature, and colonizing new tissues represent major steps of the metastatic cascade and pose a big challenge for metastasizing tumor cells. Tumor cells circulating in blood and lymph vessels need to overcome anoikis, cope with mechanical stimuli including shear stress, and defeat attacks by the immune system. Once adhered to the vessel wall, a circulating tumor cell (CTC) can trick the endothelial cells into loosening their intercellular junctions so that the endothelium becomes penetrable for the tumor cell. Since tumor cells tend to metastasize to predestinated target organs and tissues, called organotropism, the distribution of metastases is anything but random. The molecular-physiological mechanisms underlying CTC survival, extravasation, and organotropism are very likely to include the presence and activity of ion channels/transporters due to the latter's key function in cytophysiological processes. To date, a very limited number of studies explicitly show the involvement of ion transport. This review describes the contribution of ion channels and transporters to CTC survival, extravasation, and organotropism where known and possible. In addition, supposed connections between ion transport and CTC behavior are demonstrated and imply the potential to be therapeutically taken advantage of.},

@article{Thompson2016,
 abstract = {Malignant gliomas are devastating tumors, frequently killing those diagnosed in little over a year. The profuse infiltration of glioma cells into healthy tissue surrounding the main tumor mass is one of the major obstacles limiting the improvement of patient survival. Migration along the abluminal side of blood vessels is one of the salient features of glioma cell invasion. Invading glioma cells are attracted to the vascular network, in part by the neuropeptide bradykinin, where glioma cells actively modify the gliovascular interface and undergo volumetric alterations to navigate the confined space. Critical to these volume modifications is a proposed hydrodynamic model that involves the flux of ions in and out of the cell, followed by osmotically obligated water. Ion and water channels expressed by the glioma cell are essential in this model of invasion and make opportune therapeutic targets. Lastly, there is growing evidence that vascular-associated glioma cells are able to control the vascular tone, presumably to free up space for invasion and growth. The unique mechanisms that enable perivascular glioma invasion may offer critical targets for therapeutic intervention in this devastating disease. Indeed, a chloride channel-blocking peptide has already been successfully tested in human clinical trials.},

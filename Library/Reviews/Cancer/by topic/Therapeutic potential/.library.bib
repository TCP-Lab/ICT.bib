 abstract = {Ion transporting proteins (ITPs) comprise a wide range of ion channels, exchangers, pumps and ionotropic receptors many of which are expressed in tumours and contribute dynamically to the different components and stages of the complex cancer process, from initiation to metastasis. In this promising major field of biomedical research, several candidate ITPs have emerged as clinically viable. Here, we consider a series of general issues concerning the oncological potential of ITPs focusing on voltage-gated sodium channels as a ‘case study'. First, we outline some key properties of ‘cancer' as a whole. These include epigenetics, stemness, metastasis, heterogeneity, neuronal characteristics and bioelectricity. Cancer specificity of ITP expression is evaluated in relation to tissue restriction, splice variance, functional specificity and macro-molecular complexing. As regards clinical potential, diagnostics is covered with emphasis on enabling early detection. For therapeutics, we deal with molecular approaches, drug repurposing and combinations. Importantly, we emphasise the need for carefully designed clinical trials. We highlight also the area of ‘social responsibility' and the need to involve the public (cancer patients and healthy individuals) in the work of cancer research professionals as well as clinicians. In advising patients how best to manage cancer, and live with it, we offer the following four principles: Awareness and prevention, early detection, specialist, integrated care, and psychological support. Finally, we highlight four key prerequisites for commercialisation of ITP-based technologies against cancer. We conclude that ITPs offer significant potential as regards both understanding the intricacies of the complex process of cancer and for developing much needed novel therapies.},

 abstract = {Ion transport across the cell membrane mediated by channels and carriers participate in the regulation of tumour cell survival, death and motility. Moreover, the altered regulation of channels and carriers is part of neoplastic transformation. Experimental modification of channel and transporter activity impacts tumour cell survival, proliferation, malignant progression, invasive behaviour or therapy resistance of tumour cells. A wide variety of distinct Ca2+ permeable channels, K+ channels, Nathorn channels and anion channels have been implicated in tumour growth and metastasis. Further experimental information is, however, needed to define the specific role of individual channel isoforms critically important for malignancy. Compelling experimental evidence supports the assumption that the pharmacological inhibition of ion channels or their regulators may be attractive targets to counteract tumour growth, prevent metastasis and overcome therapy resistance of tumour cells. This short review discusses the role of Ca2+ permeable channels, K+ channels, Nathorn channels and anion channels in tumour growth and metastasis and the therapeutic potential of respective inhibitors. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.},

@article{Ramirez2022,
 abstract = {The expression and function of many ion channels and transporters in cancer cells display major differences in comparison to those from healthy cells. These differences provide the cancer cells with advantages for tumor development. Accordingly, targeting ion channels and transporters have beneficial anticancer effects including inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis, tumor vascularization, and chemotherapy resistance, as well as promoting apoptosis. Some of the molecular mechanisms associating ion channels and transporters with cancer include the participation of oxidative stress, immune response, metabolic pathways, drug synergism, as well as noncanonical functions of ion channels. This diversity of mechanisms offers an exciting possibility to suggest novel and more effective therapeutic approaches to fight cancer. Here, we review and discuss most of the current knowledge suggesting novel therapeutic approaches for cancer therapy targeting ion channels and transporters. The role and regulation of ion channels and transporters in cancer provide a plethora of exceptional opportunities in drug design, as well as novel and promising therapeutic approaches that may be used for the benefit of cancer patients.},

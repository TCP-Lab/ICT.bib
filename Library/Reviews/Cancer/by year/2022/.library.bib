 abstract = {Solid tumors, including breast carcinomas, are heterogeneous but typically characterized by elevated cellular turnover and metabolism, diffusion limitations based on the complex tumor architecture, and abnormal intra- and extracellular ion compositions particularly as regards acid-base equivalents. Carcinogenesis-related alterations in expression and function of ion channels and transporters, cellular energy levels, and organellar H+ sequestration further modify the acid-base composition within tumors and influence cancer cell functions, including cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Cancer cells defend their cytosolic pH and HCO3− concentrations better than normal cells when challenged with the marked deviations in extracellular H+, HCO3−, and lactate concentrations typical of the tumor microenvironment. Ionic gradients determine the driving forces for ion transporters and channels and influence the membrane potential. Cancer and stromal cells also sense abnormal ion concentrations via intra- and extracellular receptors that modify cancer progression and prognosis. With emphasis on breast cancer, the current review first addresses the altered ion composition and the changes in expression and functional activity of ion channels and transporters in solid cancer tissue. It then discusses how ion channels, transporters, and cellular sensors under influence of the acidic tumor microenvironment shape cancer development and progression and affect the potential of cancer therapies.},

@article{Capatina2022,
 abstract = {Ion channels are key regulators of cancer cell pathophysiology. They contribute to a variety of processes such as maintenance of cellular osmolarity and membrane potential, motility (via interactions with the cytoskeleton), invasion, signal transduction, transcriptional activity and cell cycle progression, leading to tumour progression and metastasis. Ion channels thus represent promising targets for cancer therapy. Ion channels are attractive targets because many of them are expressed at the plasma membrane and a broad range of existing inhibitors are already in clinical use for other indications. However, many of the ion channels identified in cancer cells are also active in healthy normal cells, so there is a risk that certain blockers may have off-target effects on normal physiological function. This review describes recent research advances into ion channel inhibitors as anticancer therapeutics. A growing body of evidence suggests that a range of existing and novel Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Cl− channel inhibitors may be effective for suppressing cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as enhancing apoptosis, leading to suppression of tumour growth and metastasis, either alone or in combination with standard-of-care therapies. The majority of evidence to date is based on preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies, although there are several examples of ion channel-targeting strategies now reaching early phase clinical trials. Given the strong links between ion channel function and regulation of tumour growth, metastasis and chemotherapy resistance, it is likely that further work in this area will facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches which will reach the clinic in the future.},

 abstract = {Ion transporting proteins (ITPs) comprise a wide range of ion channels, exchangers, pumps and ionotropic receptors many of which are expressed in tumours and contribute dynamically to the different components and stages of the complex cancer process, from initiation to metastasis. In this promising major field of biomedical research, several candidate ITPs have emerged as clinically viable. Here, we consider a series of general issues concerning the oncological potential of ITPs focusing on voltage-gated sodium channels as a ‘case study'. First, we outline some key properties of ‘cancer' as a whole. These include epigenetics, stemness, metastasis, heterogeneity, neuronal characteristics and bioelectricity. Cancer specificity of ITP expression is evaluated in relation to tissue restriction, splice variance, functional specificity and macro-molecular complexing. As regards clinical potential, diagnostics is covered with emphasis on enabling early detection. For therapeutics, we deal with molecular approaches, drug repurposing and combinations. Importantly, we emphasise the need for carefully designed clinical trials. We highlight also the area of ‘social responsibility' and the need to involve the public (cancer patients and healthy individuals) in the work of cancer research professionals as well as clinicians. In advising patients how best to manage cancer, and live with it, we offer the following four principles: Awareness and prevention, early detection, specialist, integrated care, and psychological support. Finally, we highlight four key prerequisites for commercialisation of ITP-based technologies against cancer. We conclude that ITPs offer significant potential as regards both understanding the intricacies of the complex process of cancer and for developing much needed novel therapies.},

@article{Ramirez2022,
 abstract = {The expression and function of many ion channels and transporters in cancer cells display major differences in comparison to those from healthy cells. These differences provide the cancer cells with advantages for tumor development. Accordingly, targeting ion channels and transporters have beneficial anticancer effects including inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, migration, invasion, metastasis, tumor vascularization, and chemotherapy resistance, as well as promoting apoptosis. Some of the molecular mechanisms associating ion channels and transporters with cancer include the participation of oxidative stress, immune response, metabolic pathways, drug synergism, as well as noncanonical functions of ion channels. This diversity of mechanisms offers an exciting possibility to suggest novel and more effective therapeutic approaches to fight cancer. Here, we review and discuss most of the current knowledge suggesting novel therapeutic approaches for cancer therapy targeting ion channels and transporters. The role and regulation of ion channels and transporters in cancer provide a plethora of exceptional opportunities in drug design, as well as novel and promising therapeutic approaches that may be used for the benefit of cancer patients.},

These alterations are crucial elements of the phenotypical reprogramming of the transformed cells and may promote adaptation to hypoxia, malignant progression, tumor spreading and metastasis, as well as therapy resistance. The present review article focuses on ion transport processes in tumor cells that are induced by ionizing radiation and that contribute to radioresistance and therapy failure. In particular, this article introduces radiogenic ion transports across plasma and mitochondrial membranes and discusses their functional significance for cell cycle control, DNA repair, accelerated repopulation, cell migration and metastasis, metabolic reprogramming, adaptation to hypoxia, and radiogenic formation of reactive oxygen species.},

@article{Stock2022,
 abstract = {Survival in the circulation, extravasation from vasculature, and colonizing new tissues represent major steps of the metastatic cascade and pose a big challenge for metastasizing tumor cells. Tumor cells circulating in blood and lymph vessels need to overcome anoikis, cope with mechanical stimuli including shear stress, and defeat attacks by the immune system. Once adhered to the vessel wall, a circulating tumor cell (CTC) can trick the endothelial cells into loosening their intercellular junctions so that the endothelium becomes penetrable for the tumor cell. Since tumor cells tend to metastasize to predestinated target organs and tissues, called organotropism, the distribution of metastases is anything but random. The molecular-physiological mechanisms underlying CTC survival, extravasation, and organotropism are very likely to include the presence and activity of ion channels/transporters due to the latter's key function in cytophysiological processes. To date, a very limited number of studies explicitly show the involvement of ion transport. This review describes the contribution of ion channels and transporters to CTC survival, extravasation, and organotropism where known and possible. In addition, supposed connections between ion transport and CTC behavior are demonstrated and imply the potential to be therapeutically taken advantage of.},

Rapidly emerging evidence has shown that tissue-specific expression of transporters contributes to local drug accumulation and drug–drug interactions and that functional alterations in these transporters can directly influence an individual's susceptibility to drug-induced toxicity. Comprehending the complex mechanism of transporter function in regulating drug distribution in tissues, such as the heart, is necessary in order to acquire novel therapeutic strategies aimed at evading unwanted drug accumulation and toxicities and to ameliorate the safety of current therapeutic regimens.

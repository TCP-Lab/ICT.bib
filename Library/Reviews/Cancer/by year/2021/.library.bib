 abstract = {Ovarian cancer (OC) is the deadliest gynecologic cancer, due to late diagnosis, development of platinum resistance, and inadequate alternative therapy. It has been demonstrated that membrane ion channels play important roles in cancer processes, including cell proliferation, apop-tosis, motility, and invasion. Here, we review the contribution of ion channels in the development and progression of OC, evaluating their potential in clinical management. Increased expression of voltage-gated and epithelial sodium channels has been detected in OC cells and tissues and shown to be involved in cancer proliferation and invasion. Potassium and calcium channels have been found to play a critical role in the control of cell cycle and in the resistance to apoptosis, promoting tumor growth and recurrence. Overexpression of chloride and transient receptor potential channels was found both in vitro and in vivo, supporting their contribution to OC. Furthermore, ion channels have been shown to influence the sensitivity of OC cells to neoplastic drugs, suggesting a critical role in chemotherapy resistance. The study of ion channels expression and function in OC can improve our understanding of pathophysiology and pave the way for identifying ion channels as potential targets for tumor diagnosis and treatment.},

 abstract = {Solid tumors, including breast carcinomas, are heterogeneous but typically characterized by elevated cellular turnover and metabolism, diffusion limitations based on the complex tumor architecture, and abnormal intra- and extracellular ion compositions particularly as regards acid-base equivalents. Carcinogenesis-related alterations in expression and function of ion channels and transporters, cellular energy levels, and organellar H+ sequestration further modify the acid-base composition within tumors and influence cancer cell functions, including cell proliferation, migration, and survival. Cancer cells defend their cytosolic pH and HCO3− concentrations better than normal cells when challenged with the marked deviations in extracellular H+, HCO3−, and lactate concentrations typical of the tumor microenvironment. Ionic gradients determine the driving forces for ion transporters and channels and influence the membrane potential. Cancer and stromal cells also sense abnormal ion concentrations via intra- and extracellular receptors that modify cancer progression and prognosis. With emphasis on breast cancer, the current review first addresses the altered ion composition and the changes in expression and functional activity of ion channels and transporters in solid cancer tissue. It then discusses how ion channels, transporters, and cellular sensors under influence of the acidic tumor microenvironment shape cancer development and progression and affect the potential of cancer therapies.},

For example, members of the ABC family were shown to support cancer stemness-like features in melanoma cells, while several members of the TRP channel family were reported to act as tumor suppressors.Also, many transporter proteins support tumor cell viability and thus suppress apoptosis induction by anticancer therapy. Due to the high number of ion channels and transporters and the resulting high complexity of the field, progress in understanding is often focused on single molecules and is in total rather slow. In this review, we aim at giving an overview about a broad subset of ion transporters, also illustrating some aspects of the field, which have not been addressed in detail in melanoma. In context with the other chapters in this special issue on "Transportome Malfunctions in the Cancer Spectrum," a comparison between melanoma and these tumors will be possible.},

 abstract = {Ion channels are a major class of membrane proteins that play central roles in signaling within and among cells, as well as in the coupling of extracellular events with cellular responses. Dysregulated ion channel activity plays a causative role in many diseases including cancer. Here, we will review their role in lung cancer. Lung cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers, and it causes the highest number of deaths of all cancer types. The overall 5-year survival rate of lung cancer patients is only 19% and decreases to 5% when patients are diagnosed with stage IV. Thus, new therapeutical strategies are urgently needed. The important contribution of ion channels to the progression of various types of cancer has been firmly established so that ion channel-based therapeutic concepts are currently developed. Thus far, the knowledge on ion channel function in lung cancer is still relatively limited. However, the published studies clearly show the impact of ion channel inhibitors on a number of cellular mechanisms underlying lung cancer cell aggressiveness such as proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle progression, or adhesion. Additionally, in vivo experiments reveal that ion channel inhibitors diminish tumor growth in mice. Furthermore, some studies give evidence that ion channel inhibitors can have an influence on the resistance or sensitivity of lung cancer cells to common chemotherapeutics such as paclitaxel or cisplatin.},

 abstract = {Brain tumors come in many types and differ greatly in outcome. They are classified by the cell of origin (astrocytoma, ependymoma, meningioma, medulloblastoma, glioma), although more recently molecular markers are used in addition to histology. Brain tumors are graded (from I to IV) to measure their malignancy. Glioblastoma, one of the most common adult primary brain tumors, displays the highest malignancy (grade IV), and median survival of about 15 months. Main reasons for poor outcome are incomplete surgical resection, due to the highly invasive potential of glioblastoma cells, and chemoresistance that commonly develops during drug treatment. An important role in brain tumor malignancy is played by ion channels. The Ca2+-activated K+ channels of large and intermediate conductance, KCa3.1 and KCa1.1, and the volume-regulated anion channel, whose combined activity results in the extrusion of KCl and osmotic water, control cell volume, and in turn migration, invasion, and apoptotic cell death. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and low threshold-activated Ca (T-type) channels have equally critical role in brain tumor malignancy, as dysregulated Ca2+ signals heavily impact on glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion. The review provides an overview of the current evidence involving these channels in brain tumor malignancy, and the application of these insights in the light of future prospects for experimental and clinical practice.},

 abstract = {Background: Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant cancers in the world and has only few treatment options and, concomitantly, a poor prognosis. It is generally accepted now that the tumor microenvironment, particularly that under hypoxia, plays an important role in cancer development. Hypoxia can regulate the energy metabolism and malignancy of tumor cells by inducing or altering various important factors, such as oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS), hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), autophagy and acidosis. In addition, altered expression and/or dysfunction of ion channels/transporters (ICTs) have been encountered in a variety of human tumors, including GC, and to play an important role in the processes of tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Increasing evidence indicates that ICTs are at least partly involved in interactions between cancer cells and their hypoxic microenvironment. Here, we provide an overview of the different ICTs that regulate or are regulated by hypoxia in GC. Conclusions and perspectives: Hypoxia is one of the major obstacles to cancer therapy. Regulating cellular responses and factors under hypoxia can inhibit GC. Similarly, altering the expression or activity of ICTs, such as the application of ion channel inhibitors, can slow down the growth and/or migration of GC cells. Since targeting the hypoxic microenvironment and/or ICTs may be a promising strategy for the treatment of GC, more attention should be paid to the interplay between ICTs and the development and progression of GC in such a microenvironment.},

 abstract = {Head and neck cancers are a highly complex and heterogeneous group of malignancies that involve very diverse anatomical structures and distinct aetiological factors, treatments and clinical outcomes. Among them, head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are predominant and the sixth most common cancer worldwide with still low survival rates. Omic technologies have unravelled the intricacies of tumour biology, harbouring a large diversity of genetic and molecular changes to drive the carcinogenesis process. Nonetheless, this remarkable heterogeneity of molecular alterations opens up an immense opportunity to discover novel biomarkers and develop molecular-targeted therapies. Increasing evidence demonstrates that dysregulation of ion channel expression and/or function is frequently and commonly observed in a variety of cancers from different origin. As a consequence, the concept of ion channels as potential membrane therapeutic targets and/or biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis has attracted growing attention. This chapter intends to comprehensively and critically review the current state-of-art ion channel dysregulation specifically focusing on head and neck cancers and to formulate the major challenges and research needs to translate this knowledge into clinical application. Based on current reported data, various voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels (i.e. Kv3.4, Kv10.1 and Kv11.1) have been found frequently aberrantly expressed in HNSCC as well as precancerous lesions and are highlighted as clinically and biologically relevant features in both early stages of tumourigenesis and late stages of disease progression. More importantly, they also emerge as promising candidates as cancer risk markers, tumour markers and potential anti-proliferative and anti-metastatic targets for therapeutic interventions; however, the oncogenic properties seem to be independent of their ion-conducting function.},

The changes in the expression of individual ion channels show a specific profile, making these proteins promising clinical biomarkers that may enable better molecular subtyping of the disease and lead to more rapid and accurate clinical decision-making. Expression profiles and channel function are mainly based on the tumoral tissue itself, in this case, the epithelial cancer cell population. To date, little data on the ion channel profile of the cancerous prostate stroma are available, even though tumor interactions with the microenvironment are crucial in carcinogenesis and each distinct population plays a specific role in tumor progression. In this review, we describe ion channel expression profiles specific for the distinct cell population of the tumor microenvironment (stromal, endothelial, neuronal, and neuroendocrine cell populations) and the technical approaches used for efficient separation and screening of these cell populations.},

Hence this review focuses on the role of ICT malfunctions in context with the hallmarks of PDAC. After briefly introducing epidemiology and history of molecular oncology of PDAC and summarizing the recent studies on molecular classification systems, we focus then on the exocrine pancreas as a very active secretory gland which considerably impacts the changes in the ion transport system (the transportome) upon malignant transformation. We highlight multiplicity of ICT members (H+ transporters, Ca2+, K+, Na+ and Cl- channels) and their functional impact in PDAC. We also present some selective therapeutic options to interfere with transportome functions and thereby with key mechanisms of malignant progression. This will hopefully contribute to a better clinical outcome based on improved therapeutic strategies for this still extremely deadly disease.},

The present review specifies virtually all ion channels and transporters whose faulty expression or regulation contributes to esophageal, hepatocellular, and colorectal cancer. The variety reaches from Ca2+, K+, Na+, and Cl- channels over divalent metal transporters, Na+ or Cl- coupled Ca2+, HCO3- and H+ exchangers to monocarboxylate carriers and organic anion and cation transporters. In several cases, the underlying mechanisms by which these ion channels/transporters are interwoven with malignancies have been fully or at least partially unveiled. Ca2+, Akt/NF-$ąppa$B, and Ca2+- or pH-dependent Wnt/$β$-catenin signaling emerge as cross points through which ion channels/transporters interfere with gene expression, modulate cell proliferation, trigger epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and promote cell motility and metastasis.

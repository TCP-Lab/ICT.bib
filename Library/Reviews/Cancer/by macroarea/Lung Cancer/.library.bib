 abstract = {Ion channels are a major class of membrane proteins that play central roles in signaling within and among cells, as well as in the coupling of extracellular events with cellular responses. Dysregulated ion channel activity plays a causative role in many diseases including cancer. Here, we will review their role in lung cancer. Lung cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers, and it causes the highest number of deaths of all cancer types. The overall 5-year survival rate of lung cancer patients is only 19% and decreases to 5% when patients are diagnosed with stage IV. Thus, new therapeutical strategies are urgently needed. The important contribution of ion channels to the progression of various types of cancer has been firmly established so that ion channel-based therapeutic concepts are currently developed. Thus far, the knowledge on ion channel function in lung cancer is still relatively limited. However, the published studies clearly show the impact of ion channel inhibitors on a number of cellular mechanisms underlying lung cancer cell aggressiveness such as proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle progression, or adhesion. Additionally, in vivo experiments reveal that ion channel inhibitors diminish tumor growth in mice. Furthermore, some studies give evidence that ion channel inhibitors can have an influence on the resistance or sensitivity of lung cancer cells to common chemotherapeutics such as paclitaxel or cisplatin.},

@article{Zhang2021,
 abstract = {Lung cancer is caused by several environmental and genetic variables and is globally associated with elevated morbidity and mortality. Among these variables, membrane-bound ion channels have a key role in regulating multiple signaling pathways in tumor cells and dysregulation of ion channel expression and function is closely related to proliferation, migration, and metastasis of lung cancer. This work reviews and summarizes current knowledge about the role of ion channels in lung cancer, focusing on the changes in the expression and function of various ion channels in lung cancer and how these changes affect lung cancer cell biology both in vitro and in vivo as evidenced by both genetic and pharmacological studies. It can help understand the molecular mechanisms of various ion channels influencing the initiation and progression of lung cancer and shed new insights into their roles in the development and treatment of this deadly disease.},

 abstract = {Brain tumors come in many types and differ greatly in outcome. They are classified by the cell of origin (astrocytoma, ependymoma, meningioma, medulloblastoma, glioma), although more recently molecular markers are used in addition to histology. Brain tumors are graded (from I to IV) to measure their malignancy. Glioblastoma, one of the most common adult primary brain tumors, displays the highest malignancy (grade IV), and median survival of about 15Â months. Main reasons for poor outcome are incomplete surgical resection, due to the highly invasive potential of glioblastoma cells, and chemoresistance that commonly develops during drug treatment. An important role in brain tumor malignancy is played by ion channels. The Ca2+-activated K+ channels of large and intermediate conductance, KCa3.1 and KCa1.1, and the volume-regulated anion channel, whose combined activity results in the extrusion of KCl and osmotic water, control cell volume, and in turn migration, invasion, and apoptotic cell death. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and low threshold-activated Ca (T-type) channels have equally critical role in brain tumor malignancy, as dysregulated Ca2+ signals heavily impact on glioma cell proliferation, migration, invasion. The review provides an overview of the current evidence involving these channels in brain tumor malignancy, and the application of these insights in the light of future prospects for experimental and clinical practice.},

 abstract = {Malignant gliomas are devastating tumors, frequently killing those diagnosed in little over a year. The profuse infiltration of glioma cells into healthy tissue surrounding the main tumor mass is one of the major obstacles limiting the improvement of patient survival. Migration along the abluminal side of blood vessels is one of the salient features of glioma cell invasion. Invading glioma cells are attracted to the vascular network, in part by the neuropeptide bradykinin, where glioma cells actively modify the gliovascular interface and undergo volumetric alterations to navigate the confined space. Critical to these volume modifications is a proposed hydrodynamic model that involves the flux of ions in and out of the cell, followed by osmotically obligated water. Ion and water channels expressed by the glioma cell are essential in this model of invasion and make opportune therapeutic targets. Lastly, there is growing evidence that vascular-associated glioma cells are able to control the vascular tone, presumably to free up space for invasion and growth. The unique mechanisms that enable perivascular glioma invasion may offer critical targets for therapeutic intervention in this devastating disease. Indeed, a chloride channel-blocking peptide has already been successfully tested in human clinical trials.},

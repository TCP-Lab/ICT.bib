### Abstract

Lung cancer is caused by several environmental and genetic variables and is globally associated with elevated morbidity and mortality. Among these variables, membrane-bound ion channels have a key role in regulating multiple signaling pathways in tumor cells and dysregulation of ion channel expression and function is closely related to proliferation, migration, and metastasis of lung cancer. This work reviews and summarizes current knowledge about the role of ion channels in lung cancer, focusing on the changes in the expression and function of various ion channels in lung cancer and how these changes affect lung cancer cell biology both in vitro and in vivo as evidenced by both genetic and pharmacological studies. It can help understand the molecular mechanisms of various ion channels influencing the initiation and progression of lung cancer and shed new insights into their roles in the development and treatment of this deadly disease.

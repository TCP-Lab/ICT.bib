### Abstract

Ion channels are key regulators of cancer cell pathophysiology. They contribute to a variety of processes such as maintenance of cellular osmolarity and membrane potential, motility (via interactions with the cytoskeleton), invasion, signal transduction, transcriptional activity and cell cycle progression, leading to tumour progression and metastasis. Ion channels thus represent promising targets for cancer therapy. Ion channels are attractive targets because many of them are expressed at the plasma membrane and a broad range of existing inhibitors are already in clinical use for other indications. However, many of the ion channels identified in cancer cells are also active in healthy normal cells, so there is a risk that certain blockers may have off-target effects on normal physiological function. This review describes recent research advances into ion channel inhibitors as anticancer therapeutics. A growing body of evidence suggests that a range of existing and novel Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Clâˆ’ channel inhibitors may be effective for suppressing cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as enhancing apoptosis, leading to suppression of tumour growth and metastasis, either alone or in combination with standard-of-care therapies. The majority of evidence to date is based on preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies, although there are several examples of ion channel-targeting strategies now reaching early phase clinical trials. Given the strong links between ion channel function and regulation of tumour growth, metastasis and chemotherapy resistance, it is likely that further work in this area will facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches which will reach the clinic in the future.

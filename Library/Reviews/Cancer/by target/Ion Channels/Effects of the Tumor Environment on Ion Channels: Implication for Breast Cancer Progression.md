### Abstract

In recent years, it has been shown that breast cancer consists not only of neoplastic cells, but also of significant alterations in the surrounding stroma or tumor microenvironment. These alterations are now recognized as a critical element for breast cancer development and progression, as well as potential therapeutic targets. Furthermore, there is no doubt that ion channels are deregulated in breast cancer and some of which are prognostic markers of clinical outcome. Their dysregulation is also associated with aberrant signaling pathways. The number of published data on ion channels modifications by the microenvironment has significantly increased last years. Here, we summarize the state of the art on the cross talk between the tumor microenvironment and ion channels, in particular collagen 1, EGF, TGF-$Î²$, ATP, hypoxia, and pH, on the development and progression of breast cancer.

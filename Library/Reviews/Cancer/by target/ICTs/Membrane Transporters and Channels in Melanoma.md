### Abstract

Recent research has revealed that ion channels and transporters can be important players in tumor development, progression, and therapy resistance in melanoma. For example, members of the ABC family were shown to support cancer stemness-like features in melanoma cells, while several members of the TRP channel family were reported to act as tumor suppressors.Also, many transporter proteins support tumor cell viability and thus suppress apoptosis induction by anticancer therapy. Due to the high number of ion channels and transporters and the resulting high complexity of the field, progress in understanding is often focused on single molecules and is in total rather slow. In this review, we aim at giving an overview about a broad subset of ion transporters, also illustrating some aspects of the field, which have not been addressed in detail in melanoma. In context with the other chapters in this special issue on "Transportome Malfunctions in the Cancer Spectrum," a comparison between melanoma and these tumors will be possible.

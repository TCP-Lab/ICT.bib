 abstract = {Purpose of review In recent years, the field of intestinal physiology has witnessed significant progress in our understanding of the expression and function of ion transport proteins and their genes under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. This review will present some of these most recent advances in the small intestinal ion transport mechanisms. Recent findings One of the new and exciting aspects of this field has been the integration of function and structure of several intestinal transport processes. This is well exemplified by the discussed intricacies of intestinal bicarbonate secretion as well as the role of scaffolding PDZ proteins interacting with several transporters. We also discuss some of the most recent data pointing to the role of ion transporters in the pathogenesis of inflammation-associated diarrhea and their potential role in the maintenance of epithelial integrity. Summary Mouse models deficient in some of the key genes encoding ion transporters and their adapter proteins continue to provide important clues into intestinal transport processes. Several of the new in-vivo findings revise or complement past paradigms, many of which were derived from in-vitro approaches. New data on the interdependent functions of multiple transporters, as exemplified here by intestinal bicarbonate secretion, increase the complexity of the intestinal ion transport mechanisms and continue to contribute to a more integrated view of the transport phenomena in the gut. Data from patients and mouse models of intestinal inflammation also increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of inflammation-associated diarrhea. Â© 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health.},

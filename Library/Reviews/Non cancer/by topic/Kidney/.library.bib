 abstract = {Specific channels permit movement of selected ions through cellular membranes, and are of vital importance in a number of physiological processes, particularly in excitable tissues such as nerve and muscle, but also in endocrine organs and in epithelial biology. Disorders of channel proteins are termed channelopathies, and their importance is increasingly recognised within medicine. In the kidney, ion channels have critical roles enabling sodium and potassium reuptake or excretion along the nephron, in magnesium homeostasis, in the control of water reabsorption in the collecting duct, and in determining glomerular permeability. In this review, we assess the channelopathies encountered in each nephron segment, and see how their molecular and genetic characterisation in the past 20-30 years has furthered our understanding of normal kidney physiology and disease processes, aids correct diagnosis and promises future therapeutic opportunities.

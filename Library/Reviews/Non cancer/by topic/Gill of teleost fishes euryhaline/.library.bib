 abstract = {The mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) in teleost gill and equivalent tissues are important osmo-regulatory sites in maintaining ionic balance. These cells express a variety of ion pumps, transporters, and channels, which play central roles in ionic regulation. Recently, two types of MRCs have been identified in euryhaline fishes: seawater (SW)-type MRCs extrude Na and Cl ions in SW conditions; freshwater (FW)-type MRCs take up at least Cl-. Long-term development/differentiation of the two types of MRCs during adaptation to different salinities appears to be regulated mainly by endocrine factors. Osmolality, Ca2+, neurotransmitters, and fast-acting hormones rapidly regulate the SW MRCs. Recent information is assembled in this review and suggests the functional plasticity of highly specialized MRCs.},

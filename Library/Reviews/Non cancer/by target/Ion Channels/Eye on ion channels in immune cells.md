### Abstract

Ion channels facilitate the movement of ions across the plasma and organellar membranes. A recent symposium brought together scientists who study ion channels and transporters in immune cells, which highlighted advances in this emerging field and served to chart new avenues for investigating the roles of ion channels in immunity.

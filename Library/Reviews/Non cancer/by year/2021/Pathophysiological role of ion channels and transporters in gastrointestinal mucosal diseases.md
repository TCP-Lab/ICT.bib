### Abstract

The incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal diseases, including various types of gastritis, ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease and GI cancer, is increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to identify new therapeutic targets. Ion channels/transporters are located on cell membranes, and tight junctions (TJs) affect acid–base balance, the mucus layer, permeability, the microbiota and mucosal blood flow, which are essential for maintaining GI mucosal integrity. As ion channel/transporter dysfunction results in various GI mucosal diseases, this review focuses on understanding the contribution of ion channels/transporters to protecting the GI mucosal barrier and the relationship between GI mucosal disease and ion channels/transporters, including Cl−/HCO3− exchangers, Cl− channels, aquaporins, Na+/H+ exchangers, and K+ channels. Here, we provide novel prospects for the treatment of GI mucosal diseases.

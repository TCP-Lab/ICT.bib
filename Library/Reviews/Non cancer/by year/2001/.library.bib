 abstract = {Ion channels provide the basis for the regulation of excitability in the central nervous system and in other excitable tissues such as skeletal and heart muscle. Consequently, mutations in ion channel encoding genes are found in a variety of inherited diseases associated with hyper- or hypoexcitability of the affected tissue, the so-called 'channelopathies.' An increasing number of epileptic syndromes belongs to this group of rare disorders: Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy is caused by mutations in a neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (affected genes: CHRNA4, CHRNB2), benign familial neonatal convulsions by mutations in potassium channels constituting the M-current (KCNQ2, KCNQ3), generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus by mutations in subunits of the voltagegated sodium channel or the GABAA receptor (SCN1B, SCN1A, GABRG2), and episodic ataxia type 1 - which is associated with epilepsy in a few patients -by mutations within another voltage-gated potassium channel (KCNA1). These rare disorders provide interesting models to study the etiology and pathophysiology of disturbed excitability in molecular detail. On the basis of genetic and electrophysiologic studies of the channelopathies, novel therapeutic strategies can be developed, as has been shown recently for the antiepileptic drug retigabine activating neuronal KCNQ potassium channels.

@article{Sakamoto2001,
 abstract = {The mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) in teleost gill and equivalent tissues are important osmo-regulatory sites in maintaining ionic balance. These cells express a variety of ion pumps, transporters, and channels, which play central roles in ionic regulation. Recently, two types of MRCs have been identified in euryhaline fishes: seawater (SW)-type MRCs extrude Na and Cl ions in SW conditions; freshwater (FW)-type MRCs take up at least Cl-. Long-term development/differentiation of the two types of MRCs during adaptation to different salinities appears to be regulated mainly by endocrine factors. Osmolality, Ca2+, neurotransmitters, and fast-acting hormones rapidly regulate the SW MRCs. Recent information is assembled in this review and suggests the functional plasticity of highly specialized MRCs.},

@article{Schwab2001,
 abstract = {Cell migration plays a central role in many physiological and pathophysiological processes, such as embryogenesis, immune defense, wound healing, or the formation of tumor metastases. Detailed models have been developed that describe cytoskeletal mechanisms of cell migration. However, evidence is emerging that ion channels and transporters also play an important role in cell migration. The purpose of this review is to examine the function and subcellular distribution of ion channels and transporters in cell migration. Topics covered will be a brief overview of cytoskeletal mechanisms of migration, the role of ion channels and transporters involved in cell migration, and ways by which a polarized distribution of ion channels and transporters can be achieved in migrating cells. Moreover, a model is proposed that combines ion transport with cytoskeletal mechanisms of migration.},

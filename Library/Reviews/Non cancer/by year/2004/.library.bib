 abstract = {Inner ear physiology is reviewed with emphasis on features common to renal physiology. Genetic disorders in transporters/channels for chloride (ClC-K), bicarbonate (Cl-/HCO3- exchanger), protons (H+-ATPase), sodium (ENaC, NKKC1, NBC3, NHE3), potassium (KCNQ1/KCNE1, Kcc4), and water (AQP4) in the inner ear and their relation to the kidney are discussed. Based on data from human disorders (with or without mouse counterparts) and mouse models (without human counterparts) this article focuses on the involvement of these transporters/channels in hearing loss.

 abstract = {Skin melanocytes and ocular pigment cells contain specialized organelles called melanosomes, which are responsible for the synthesis of melanin, the major pigment in mammals. Defects in the complex mechanisms involved in melanin synthesis and regulation result in vision and pigmentation deficits, impaired development of the visual system, and increased susceptibility to skin and eye cancers. Ion transport across cellular membranes is critical for many biological processes, including pigmentation, but the molecular mechanisms by which it regulates melanin synthesis, storage, and transfer are not understood. In this review we first discuss ion channels and transporters that function at the plasma membrane of melanocytes; in the second part we consider ion transport across the membrane of intracellular organelles, with emphasis on melanosomes. We discuss recently characterized lysosomal and endosomal ion channels and transporters associated with pigmentation phenotypes. We then review the evidence for melanosomal channels and transporters critical for pigmentation, discussing potential molecular mechanisms mediating their function. The studies investigating ion transport in pigmentation physiology open new avenues for future research and could reveal novel molecular mechanisms underlying melanogenesis.},

 abstract = {Understanding the mechanisms that underlie nutrient use efficiency and carbon allocation along with mycorrhizal interactions is critical for managing croplands and forests soundly. Indeed, nutrient availability, uptake and exchange in biotrophic interactions drive plant growth and modulate biomass allocation. These parameters are crucial for plant yield, a major issue in the context of high biomass production. Transport processes across the polarized membrane interfaces are of major importance in the functioning of the established mycorrhizal association as the symbiotic relationship is based on a 'fair trade' between the fungus and the host plant. Nutrient and/or metabolite uptake and exchanges, at biotrophic interfaces, are controlled by membrane transporters whose regulation patterns are essential for determining the outcome of plant-fungus interactions and adapting to changes in soil nutrient quantity and/or quality. In the present review, we summarize the current state of the art regarding transport systems in the two major forms of mycorrhiza, namely ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhiza. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

 abstract = {In mammals, sperm fertilization potential relies on efficient progression within the female genital tract to reach and fertilize the oocyte. This fundamental property is supported by the flagellum, an evolutionarily conserved organelle that provides the mechanical force for sperm propulsion and motility. Importantly several functional maturation events that occur during the journey of the sperm cells through the genital tracts are necessary for the activation of flagellar beating and the acquisition of fertilization potential. Ion transporters and channels located at the surface of the sperm cells have been demonstrated to be involved in these processes, in particular, through the activation of downstream signaling pathways and the promotion of novel biochemical and electrophysiological properties in the sperm cells. We performed a systematic literature review to describe the currently known genetic alterations in humans that affect sperm ion transporters and channels and result in asthenozoospermia, a pathophysiological condition defined by reduced or absent sperm motility and observed in nearly 80% of infertile men. We also present the physiological relevance and functional mechanisms of additional ion channels identified in the mouse. Finally, considering the state-of-the art, we discuss future perspectives in terms of therapeutics of asthenozoospermia and male contraception.},

 abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we focus on the recent (March 2010 to September 2011) advances in small intestinal ion transport, with particular emphasis on sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and calcium transport mechanisms under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Knockout of NHERF1 and NHERF2 allowed translation of the data largely derived from the in-vitro models into a living organism. These studies also expand our knowledge about the complexity of intestinal transporter interactomes, define the role for scaffolding proteins in basal and regulated apical transport, and help identify potential targets for pharmacological approaches. We continue to accumulate novel information about the function and regulation of NHE3 (including its role in regulating paracellular Ca flux), NHE8, as well as about the complexity of the intestinal Cl and HCO3 transport in health and disease. SUMMARY: Thanks to the new genetically engineered mouse models, a significant progress has been made in our understanding of the role of NHERF proteins in regulation of intestinal Na absorption. Significant novel data on the coordinated function of bicarbonate, chloride, and sodium transporters contributes to our current views of the integrative physiology of the small intestinal electrolyte transport. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.},

@article{Gill2021,
 abstract = {The proteins of membrane transporters (MTs) are embedded within membrane-bounded organelles and are the prime targets for improvements in the efficiency of water and nutrient transportation. Their function is to maintain cellular homeostasis by controlling ionic movements across cellular channels from roots to upper plant parts, xylem loading and remobilization of sugar molecules from photosynthesis tissues in the leaf (source) to roots, stem and seeds (sink) via phloem loading. The plant's entire source-to-sink relationship is regulated by multiple transporting proteins in a highly sophisticated manner and driven based on different stages of plant growth and development (PG&D) and environmental changes. The MTs play a pivotal role in PG&D in terms of increased plant height, branches/tiller numbers, enhanced numbers, length and filled panicles per plant, seed yield and grain quality. Dynamic climatic changes disturbed ionic balance (salt, drought and heavy metals) and sugar supply (cold and heat stress) in plants. Due to poor selectivity, some of the MTs also uptake toxic elements in roots negatively impact PG&D and are later on also exported to upper parts where they deteriorate grain quality. As an adaptive strategy, in response to salt and heavy metals, plants activate plasma membranes and vacuolar membrane-localized MTs that export toxic elements into vacuole and also translocate in the root's tips and shoot. However, in case of drought, cold and heat stresses, MTs increased water and sugar supplies to all organs. In this review, we mainly review recent literature from Arabidopsis, halophytes and major field crops such as rice, wheat, maize and oilseed rape in order to argue the global role of MTs in PG&D, and abiotic stress tolerance. We also discussed gene expression level changes and genomic variations within a species as well as within a family in response to developmental and environmental cues.},

 abstract = {Hypertension (HTN), a major public health issue is currently the leading factor in the global burden of disease, where associated complications account for 9.4 million deaths worldwide every year. Excessive dietary salt intake is among the environmental factors that contribute to HTN, known as salt sensitivity. The heterogeneity of salt sensitivity and the multiple mechanisms that link high salt intake to increases in blood pressure are of upmost importance for therapeutic application. A continual increase in the kidney's reabsorption of sodium (Na+) relies on sequential actions at various segments along the nephron. When the distal segments of the nephron fail to regulate Na+, the effects on Na+homeostasis are unfavorable. We propose that the specific nephron region where increased active uptake occurs as a result of variations in Na+reabsorption is at the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL). The purpose of this review is to urge the consideration of the TAL as contributing to the pathophysiology of saltsensitive HTN. Further research in this area will enable development of a therapeutic application for targeted treatment.},

Antibodies against Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) have been used since 1996 as a marker for identifying branchial ionocytes. Immunohistochemistry of NKA by itself and in combination with Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter and CFTR Cl- channel provided convincing evidence that ionocytes are functional during seawater acclimation, and also revealed morphological variations in ionocytes among teleost species. Recent development of antibodies to freshwater- and seawater-specific isoforms of the NKA alpha-subunit has allowed functional distinction of ion absorptive and secretory ionocytes in Atlantic salmon. Cutaneous ionocytes of tilapia embryos serve as a model for branchial ionocytes, allowing identification of 4 types: two involved in ion uptake, one responsible for salt secretion and one with unknown function.

 abstract = {Compared to terrestrial animals, fish have to cope with more-challenging osmotic and ionic gradients from aquatic environments with diverse salinities, ion compositions, and pH values. Gills, a unique and highly studied organ in research on fish osmoregulation and ionoregulation, provide an excellent model to study the regulatory mechanisms of ion transport. The present review introduces and discusses some recent advances in relevant issues of teleost gill ion transport and functions of gill ionocytes. Based on accumulating evidence, a conclusive model of NaCl secretion in gills of euryhaline teleosts has been established. Interpretations of results of studies on freshwater fish gill Na+/Cl- uptake mechanisms are still being debated compared with those for NaCl secretion. Current models for Na+/Cl- uptake are proposed based on studies in traditionally used model species. Many reported inconsistencies are claimed to be due to differences among species, various experimental designs, or acclimation conditions. Having the benefit of advanced techniques in molecular/cellular biology, functional genomics, and model animals, several new notions have recently been raised concerning relevant issues of Na+/Cl- uptake pathways. Several new windows have been opened particularly in terms of molecular mechanisms of ionocyte differentiation and energy metabolite transport between gill cells during environmental challenge. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

 abstract = {Unique experimental advantages, such as its embryonic/ larval transparency, high-throughput nature, and ease of genetic modification, underpin the rapid emergence of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a preeminent model in biomedical research. Particularly in the field of nephrology, the zebrafish provides a promising model for studying the physiological implications of human solute transport processes along consecutive nephron segments. However, although the zebrafish might be considered a valuable model for numerous renal ion transport diseases and functional studies of many channels and transporters, not all human renal electrolyte transport mechanisms and human diseases can be modeled in the zebrafish. With this review, we explore the ontogeny of zebrafish renal ion transport, its nephron structure and function, and thereby demonstrate the clinical translational value of this model. By critical assessment of genomic and amino acid conservation of human proteins involved in renal ion handling (channels, transporters, and claudins), kidney and nephron segment conservation, and renal electrolyte transport physiology in the zebrafish, we provide researchers and nephrologists with an indication of the possibilities and considerations of the zebrafish as a model for human renal ion transport. Combined with advanced techniques envisioned for the future, implementation of the zebrafish might expand beyond unraveling pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie distinct genetic or environmentally, i.e., pharmacological and lifestyle, induced renal transport deficits. Specifically, the ease of drug administration and the exploitation of improved genetic approaches might argue for the adoption of the zebrafish as a model for preclinical personalized medicine for distinct renal diseases and renal electrolyte transport proteins.},

 abstract = {Purpose of review In recent years, the field of intestinal physiology has witnessed significant progress in our understanding of the expression and function of ion transport proteins and their genes under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. This review will present some of these most recent advances in the small intestinal ion transport mechanisms. Recent findings One of the new and exciting aspects of this field has been the integration of function and structure of several intestinal transport processes. This is well exemplified by the discussed intricacies of intestinal bicarbonate secretion as well as the role of scaffolding PDZ proteins interacting with several transporters. We also discuss some of the most recent data pointing to the role of ion transporters in the pathogenesis of inflammation-associated diarrhea and their potential role in the maintenance of epithelial integrity. Summary Mouse models deficient in some of the key genes encoding ion transporters and their adapter proteins continue to provide important clues into intestinal transport processes. Several of the new in-vivo findings revise or complement past paradigms, many of which were derived from in-vitro approaches. New data on the interdependent functions of multiple transporters, as exemplified here by intestinal bicarbonate secretion, increase the complexity of the intestinal ion transport mechanisms and continue to contribute to a more integrated view of the transport phenomena in the gut. Data from patients and mouse models of intestinal inflammation also increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of inflammation-associated diarrhea. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health.},

 abstract = {A number of ion channels and transporters are expressed in both the inner ear and kidney. In the inner ear, K+ cycling and endolymphatic K +, Na+, Ca2+, and pH homeostasis are critical for normal organ function. Ion channels and transporters involved in K + cycling include K+ channels, Na+-2Cl --K+ cotransporter, Na+/K+-ATPase, Cl- channels, connexins, and K+/Cl- cotransporters. Furthermore, endolymphatic Na+ and Ca2+ homeostasis depends on Ca2+-ATPase, Ca2+ channels, Na + channels, and a purinergic receptor channel. Endolymphatic pH homeostasis involves H+-ATPase and Cl-/HCO 3- exchangers including pendrin. Defective connexins (GJB2 and GJB6), pendrin (SLC26A4), K+ channels (KCNJ10, KCNQ1, KCNE1, and KCNMA1), Na+-2Cl--K+ cotransporter (SLC12A2), K+/Cl+ cotransporters (KCC3 and KCC4), Cl- channels (BSND and CLCNKA + CLCNKB), and H+-ATPase (ATP6V1B1 and ATPV0A4) cause hearing loss. All these channels and transporters are also expressed in the kidney and support renal tubular transport or signaling. The hearing loss may thus be paralleled by various renal phenotypes including a subtle decrease of proximal Na+-coupled transport (KCNE1/KCNQ1), impaired K+ secretion (KCNMA1), limited HCO3- elimination (SLC26A4), NaCl wasting (BSND and CLCNKB), renal tubular acidosis (ATP6V1B1, ATPV0A4, and KCC4), or impaired urinary concentration (CLCNKA). Thus, defects of channels and transporters expressed in the kidney and inner ear result in simultaneous dysfunctions of these seemingly unrelated organs.},

@article{Martin2020,
 abstract = {Membrane transport proteins, also known as transporters, control the movement of ions, nutrients, metabolites, and waste products across the membranes of a cell and are central to its biology. Proteins of this type also serve as drug targets and are key players in the phenomenon of drug resistance. The malaria parasite has a relatively reduced transportome, with only approximately 2.5% of its genes encoding transporters. Even so, assigning functions and physiological roles to these proteins, and ascertaining their contributions to drug action and drug resistance, has been very challenging. This review presents a detailed critique and synthesis of the disruption phenotypes, protein subcellular localisations, protein functions (observed or predicted), and links to antimalarial drug resistance for each of the parasite's transporter genes. The breadth and depth of the gene disruption data are particularly impressive, with at least one phenotype determined in the parasite's asexual blood stage for each transporter gene, and multiple phenotypes available for 76% of the genes. Analysis of the curated data set revealed there to be relatively little redundancy in the Plasmodium transportome; almost two-thirds of the parasite's transporter genes are essential or required for normal growth in the asexual blood stage of the parasite, and this proportion increased to 78% when the disruption phenotypes available for the other parasite life stages were included in the analysis. These observations, together with the finding that 22% of the transportome is implicated in the parasite's resistance to existing antimalarials and/or drugs within the development pipeline, indicate that transporters are likely to serve, or are already serving, as drug targets. Integration of the different biological and bioinformatic data sets also enabled the selection of candidates for transport processes known to be essential for parasite survival, but for which the underlying proteins have thus far remained undiscovered. These include potential transporters of pantothenate, isoleucine, or isopentenyl diphosphate, as well as putative anion-selective channels that may serve as the pore component of the parasite's ‘new permeation pathways'. Other novel insights into the parasite's biology included the identification of transporters for the potential development of antimalarial treatments, transmission-blocking drugs, prophylactics, and genetically attenuated vaccines. The syntheses presented herein set a foundation for elucidating the functions and physiological roles of key members of the Plasmodium transportome and, ultimately, to explore and realise their potential as therapeutic targets.},

This review summarizes recent developments in branchial and renal ion transport physiology and presents several models that integrate epithelial ion and acid-base movements in freshwater fishes. At the gill, three cell types are potentially involved in ionic uptake: pavement cells, mitochondria-rich (MR) PNA+ cells, and MR PNA- cells. The transfer of acidic or basic equivalents between the fish and its environment is accomplished largely by the gill and is appropriately regulated to correct acid-base imbalances. The kidney, while less important than the gill in overall acid or base excretion, has an essential role in regulating systemic acid-base balance by controlling HCO3- reabsorption from the filtrate. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

 abstract = {Ion channels and ion transporters play essential roles in the function of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). The use of cell cultures has been exploited as a key method for successfully identifying and studying ion channels and transporters of the RPE. Cultured RPE cells enable robust and long-lasting patch-clamp recordings, Ussing chamber investigations of the transepithelial transport within the isolated RPE, and analyses of the intracellular Ca2+ or pH with fluorescent probes. Furthermore, cultured RPE can be transfected at high success rates, permitting the easy use of siRNA to study the involvement of ion channels on the molecular level. However, the expression patterns of the ion channels in the RPE appear to be a very sensitive marker reflecting the extent of RPE differentiation invitro. Having originated from the neuroectoderm, cultured RPE cells seem to retain some capacity to change into a more neuronal phenotype expressing TTX-blockable Na+ channels or synaptic Ca2+ channels. Therefore, the identification of ion channels and transporters in cultured cells should be verified in freshly isolated RPE cells and in situ preparations of the RPE, via immunohistochemistry and the analysis of RPE-specific signals in the electroretinogram from transgenic animals. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Romero-Calvo2011,
 abstract = {Diarrhoea is a hallmark of intestinal inflammation. The mechanisms operating in acute inflammation of the intestine are well characterized and are related to regulatory changes induced by inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, cytokines or reactive oxygen species, along with leakage due to epithelial injury and changes in permeability. In chronic colitis, however, the mechanisms are less well known, but it is generally accepted that both secretory and absorptive processes are inhibited. These disturbances in ionic transport may be viewed as an adaptation to protracted inflammation of the intestine, since prolonged intense secretion may be physiologically unacceptable in the long term. Mechanistically, the changes in transport may be due to adjustments in the regulation of the different processes involved, to broader epithelial alterations or frank damage, or to modulation of the transportome in terms of expression. In the present review, we offer a summary of the existing evidence on the status of the transportome in chronic intestinal inflammation. ©The Authors Journal compilation ©2011 Biochemical Society.},

Long-term development/differentiation of the two types of MRCs during adaptation to different salinities appears to be regulated mainly by endocrine factors.

Knowledge about thephysiological and pathophysiological regulation of transport in the CNT and CCD and particularroles of specific channels/transporters has increased tremendously over the last two decades. Recent studies shed new light on several key questions concerning the regulation of renal transport. Precise distribution patterns of transport proteins in the CCD and CNT will be reviewed, andtheir physiological roles and mechanisms mediating ion transport in these segments will also becovered.

@article{Stock2013,
 abstract = {Cell motility is an essential feature of life. It is essential for reproduction, propagation, embryonic development, and healing processes such as wound closure and a successful immune defense. If out of control, cell motility can become life-threatening as, for example, in metastasis or autoimmune diseases. Regardless of whether ciliary/flagellar or amoeboid movement, controlled motility always requires a concerted action of ion channels and transporters, cytoskeletal elements, and signaling cascades. Ion transport across the plasma membrane contributes to cell motility by affecting the membrane potential and voltage-sensitive ion channels, by inducing local volume changes with the help of aquaporins and by modulating cytosolic Ca2+ and H+ concentrations. Voltage-sensitive ion channels serve as voltage detectors in electric fields thus enabling galvanotaxis; local swelling facilitates the outgrowth of protrusions at the leading edge while local shrinkage accompanies the retraction of the cell rear; the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration exerts its main effect on cytoskeletal dynamics via motor proteins such as myosin or dynein; and both, the intracellular and the extracellular H2+ concentration modulate cell migration and adhesion by tuning the activity of enzymes and signaling molecules in the cytosol as well as the activation state of adhesion molecules at the cell surface. In addition to the actual process of ion transport, both, channels and transporters contribute to cell migration by being part of focal adhesion complexes and/or physically interacting with components of the cytoskeleton. The present article provides an overview of how the numerous ion-transport mechanisms contribute to the various modes of cell motility. © 2013 American Physiological Society.},

 abstract = {This review focuses on the most recent advances in the understanding of the electrolyte transport-relatedmechanisms important for the development of severe inherited renal disorders, autosomal dominant (AD) and recessive (AR) forms of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). We provide here a basic overview of the origins and clinical aspects of ARPKD and ADPKD and discuss the implications of electrolyte transport in cystogenesis. Special attention is devoted to intracellular calcium handling by the cystic cells, with a focus on polycystins and fibrocystin, as well as other calcium level regulators, such as transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) channels, ciliary machinery, and purinergic receptor remodeling. Sodium transport is reviewed with a focus on the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), and the role of chloride-dependent fluid secretion in cystic fluid accumulation is discussed. In addition, we highlight the emerging promising concepts in the field, such as potassium transport, and suggest some new avenues for research related to electrolyte handling.},

@article{Takvam2021,
 abstract = {Euryhaline teleosts exhibit major changes in renal function as they move between freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW) environments, thus tolerating large fluctuations in salinity. In FW, the kidney excretes large volumes of water through high glomerular filtration rates (GFR) and low tubular reabsorption rates, while actively reabsorbing most ions at high rates. The excreted product has a high urine flow rate (UFR) with a dilute composition. In SW, GFR is greatly reduced, and the tubules reabsorb as much water as possible, while actively secreting divalent ions. The excreted product has a low UFR, and is almost isosmotic to the blood plasma, with Mg2+, SO42–, and Cl– as the major ionic components. Early studies at the organismal level have described these basic patterns, while in the last two decades, studies of regulation at the cell and molecular level have been implemented, though only in a few euryhaline groups (salmonids, eels, tilapias, and fugus). There have been few studies combining the two approaches. The aim of the review is to integrate known aspects of renal physiology (reabsorption and secretion) with more recent advances in molecular water and solute physiology (gene and protein function of transporters). The renal transporters addressed include the subunits of the Na+, K+- ATPase (NKA) enzyme, monovalent ion transporters for Na+, Cl–, and K+ (NKCC1, NKCC2, CLC-K, NCC, ROMK2), water transport pathways [aquaporins (AQP), claudins (CLDN)], and divalent ion transporters for SO42–, Mg2+, and Ca2+ (SLC26A6, SLC26A1, SLC13A1, SLC41A1, CNNM2, CNNM3, NCX1, NCX2, PMCA). For each transport category, we address the current understanding at the molecular level, try to synthesize it with classical knowledge of overall renal function, and highlight knowledge gaps. Future research on the kidney of euryhaline fishes should focus on integrating changes in kidney reabsorption and secretion of ions with changes in transporter function at the cellular and molecular level (gene and protein verification) in different regions of the nephrons. An increased focus on the kidney individually and its functional integration with the other osmoregulatory organs (gills, skin and intestine) in maintaining overall homeostasis will have applied relevance for aquaculture.},

@article{Wiriyasermkul2020,
 abstract = {Melanosomes are unique organelles in melanocytes that produce melanin, the pigment for skin, hair, and eye color. Tyrosinase is the essential and rate-limiting enzyme for melanin production, that strictly requires neutral pH for activity. pH maintenance is a result of the combinational function of multiple ion transport proteins. Thus, ion homeostasis in melanosomes is crucial for melanin synthesis. Defect of the ion transport system causes various pigmentation phenotypes, from mild effect to severe disorders such as albinism. In this review, we summarize the up-to-date knowledge of the ion transport system, such as transport function, structure, and the physiological roles and mechanisms of the ion transport proteins in melanosomes. In addition, we propose a model of melanosomal ion transport system—how the functional coupling of multiple transport proteins modulates and maintains ion homeostasis. We discuss melanin synthesis in terms of the ion transport system.},

@article{Zhao2022,
 abstract = {Gastric mucosal injuries include focal and diffused injuries, which do and do not change the cell differentiation pattern. Parietal cells loss is related to the occurrence of gastric mucosal diffused injury, with two phenotypes of spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia and neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, which is the basis of gastric cancer and gastric neuroendocrine tumor respectively. Multiple ion channels and transporters are located and expressed in the parietal cells, which is not only regulate the gastric acid-base homeostasis, but also regulate the growth and development of parietal cells. Therefore, alteration and dysregulation of ion channels and transporters in the parietal cells impairs the morphology and physiological functions of stomach, resulted in gastric diffused mucosal damage. In this review, multiple ion channels and transporters in parietal cells, including K+ channels, aquaporins, Cl- channels, Na+/H+ transporters, and Cl-/HCO3- transporters are described, and their roles in gastric diffused mucosal injury are discussed. We hope to drive researcher's attention to focus on the role of ion channels/transporters loss in the parietal cells induced gastric diffused mucosal injury.},

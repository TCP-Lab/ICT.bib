 abstract = {The incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal diseases, including various types of gastritis, ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease and GI cancer, is increasing. Therefore, it is necessary to identify new therapeutic targets. Ion channels/transporters are located on cell membranes, and tight junctions (TJs) affect acid–base balance, the mucus layer, permeability, the microbiota and mucosal blood flow, which are essential for maintaining GI mucosal integrity. As ion channel/transporter dysfunction results in various GI mucosal diseases, this review focuses on understanding the contribution of ion channels/transporters to protecting the GI mucosal barrier and the relationship between GI mucosal disease and ion channels/transporters, including Cl−/HCO3− exchangers, Cl− channels, aquaporins, Na+/H+ exchangers, and K+ channels. Here, we provide novel prospects for the treatment of GI mucosal diseases.},

 abstract = {Diarrhoea is a hallmark of intestinal inflammation. The mechanisms operating in acute inflammation of the intestine are well characterized and are related to regulatory changes induced by inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, cytokines or reactive oxygen species, along with leakage due to epithelial injury and changes in permeability. In chronic colitis, however, the mechanisms are less well known, but it is generally accepted that both secretory and absorptive processes are inhibited. These disturbances in ionic transport may be viewed as an adaptation to protracted inflammation of the intestine, since prolonged intense secretion may be physiologically unacceptable in the long term. Mechanistically, the changes in transport may be due to adjustments in the regulation of the different processes involved, to broader epithelial alterations or frank damage, or to modulation of the transportome in terms of expression. In the present review, we offer a summary of the existing evidence on the status of the transportome in chronic intestinal inflammation. ©The Authors Journal compilation ©2011 Biochemical Society.},

@article{Zhao2022,
 abstract = {Gastric mucosal injuries include focal and diffused injuries, which do and do not change the cell differentiation pattern. Parietal cells loss is related to the occurrence of gastric mucosal diffused injury, with two phenotypes of spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia and neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia, which is the basis of gastric cancer and gastric neuroendocrine tumor respectively. Multiple ion channels and transporters are located and expressed in the parietal cells, which is not only regulate the gastric acid-base homeostasis, but also regulate the growth and development of parietal cells. Therefore, alteration and dysregulation of ion channels and transporters in the parietal cells impairs the morphology and physiological functions of stomach, resulted in gastric diffused mucosal damage. In this review, multiple ion channels and transporters in parietal cells, including K+ channels, aquaporins, Cl- channels, Na+/H+ transporters, and Cl-/HCO3- transporters are described, and their roles in gastric diffused mucosal injury are discussed. We hope to drive researcher's attention to focus on the role of ion channels/transporters loss in the parietal cells induced gastric diffused mucosal injury.},

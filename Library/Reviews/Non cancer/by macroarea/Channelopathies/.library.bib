 abstract = {The transport of ions across cellular membranes is crucial for various functions, including the transport of salt and water across epithelia, the control of electrical excitability of muscle and nerve, and the regulation of cell volume or the acidification and ionic homeostasis of intracellular organelles. This review will focus on ion channel diseases (channelopathies) that are due to impaired transepithelial transport or due to mutations in vesicular ion transporters or channels. When needed for a more comprehensive understanding of organ function, also other ion transport diseases will be mentioned. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Kullmann2010,
 abstract = {Inherited ion channel mutations can affect the entire nervous system. Many cause paroxysmal disturbances of brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve or skeletal muscle function, with normal neurological development and function in between attacks. To fully understand how mutations of ion channel genes cause disease, we need to know the normal location and function of the channel subunit, consequences of the mutation for biogenesis and biophysical properties, and possible compensatory changes in other channels that contribute to cell or circuit excitability. Animal models of monogenic channelopathies increasingly help our understanding. An important challenge for the future is to determine how more subtle derangements of ion channel function, which arise from the interaction of genetic and environmental influences, contribute to common paroxysomal disorders, including idiopathic epilepsy and migraine, that share features with rare monogenic channelopathies. © 2010 by Annual Reviews.

@article{Loudon2014,
 abstract = {Specific channels permit movement of selected ions through cellular membranes, and are of vital importance in a number of physiological processes, particularly in excitable tissues such as nerve and muscle, but also in endocrine organs and in epithelial biology. Disorders of channel proteins are termed channelopathies, and their importance is increasingly recognised within medicine. In the kidney, ion channels have critical roles enabling sodium and potassium reuptake or excretion along the nephron, in magnesium homeostasis, in the control of water reabsorption in the collecting duct, and in determining glomerular permeability. In this review, we assess the channelopathies encountered in each nephron segment, and see how their molecular and genetic characterisation in the past 20-30 years has furthered our understanding of normal kidney physiology and disease processes, aids correct diagnosis and promises future therapeutic opportunities. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.},

 abstract = {Unique experimental advantages, such as its embryonic/ larval transparency, high-throughput nature, and ease of genetic modification, underpin the rapid emergence of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a preeminent model in biomedical research. Particularly in the field of nephrology, the zebrafish provides a promising model for studying the physiological implications of human solute transport processes along consecutive nephron segments. However, although the zebrafish might be considered a valuable model for numerous renal ion transport diseases and functional studies of many channels and transporters, not all human renal electrolyte transport mechanisms and human diseases can be modeled in the zebrafish. With this review, we explore the ontogeny of zebrafish renal ion transport, its nephron structure and function, and thereby demonstrate the clinical translational value of this model. By critical assessment of genomic and amino acid conservation of human proteins involved in renal ion handling (channels, transporters, and claudins), kidney and nephron segment conservation, and renal electrolyte transport physiology in the zebrafish, we provide researchers and nephrologists with an indication of the possibilities and considerations of the zebrafish as a model for human renal ion transport. Combined with advanced techniques envisioned for the future, implementation of the zebrafish might expand beyond unraveling pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie distinct genetic or environmentally, i.e., pharmacological and lifestyle, induced renal transport deficits. Specifically, the ease of drug administration and the exploitation of improved genetic approaches might argue for the adoption of the zebrafish as a model for preclinical personalized medicine for distinct renal diseases and renal electrolyte transport proteins.},

 abstract = {This review focuses on the most recent advances in the understanding of the electrolyte transport-relatedmechanisms important for the development of severe inherited renal disorders, autosomal dominant (AD) and recessive (AR) forms of polycystic kidney disease (PKD). We provide here a basic overview of the origins and clinical aspects of ARPKD and ADPKD and discuss the implications of electrolyte transport in cystogenesis. Special attention is devoted to intracellular calcium handling by the cystic cells, with a focus on polycystins and fibrocystin, as well as other calcium level regulators, such as transient receptor potential vanilloid type 4 (TRPV4) channels, ciliary machinery, and purinergic receptor remodeling. Sodium transport is reviewed with a focus on the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), and the role of chloride-dependent fluid secretion in cystic fluid accumulation is discussed. In addition, we highlight the emerging promising concepts in the field, such as potassium transport, and suggest some new avenues for research related to electrolyte handling.},

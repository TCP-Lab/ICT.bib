 abstract = {Hypertension (HTN), a major public health issue is currently the leading factor in the global burden of disease, where associated complications account for 9.4 million deaths worldwide every year. Excessive dietary salt intake is among the environmental factors that contribute to HTN, known as salt sensitivity. The heterogeneity of salt sensitivity and the multiple mechanisms that link high salt intake to increases in blood pressure are of upmost importance for therapeutic application. A continual increase in the kidney's reabsorption of sodium (Na+) relies on sequential actions at various segments along the nephron. When the distal segments of the nephron fail to regulate Na+, the effects on Na+homeostasis are unfavorable. We propose that the specific nephron region where increased active uptake occurs as a result of variations in Na+reabsorption is at the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL). The purpose of this review is to urge the consideration of the TAL as contributing to the pathophysiology of saltsensitive HTN. Further research in this area will enable development of a therapeutic application for targeted treatment.},

@article{Kersten2017,
 abstract = {Unique experimental advantages, such as its embryonic/ larval transparency, high-throughput nature, and ease of genetic modification, underpin the rapid emergence of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a preeminent model in biomedical research. Particularly in the field of nephrology, the zebrafish provides a promising model for studying the physiological implications of human solute transport processes along consecutive nephron segments. However, although the zebrafish might be considered a valuable model for numerous renal ion transport diseases and functional studies of many channels and transporters, not all human renal electrolyte transport mechanisms and human diseases can be modeled in the zebrafish. With this review, we explore the ontogeny of zebrafish renal ion transport, its nephron structure and function, and thereby demonstrate the clinical translational value of this model. By critical assessment of genomic and amino acid conservation of human proteins involved in renal ion handling (channels, transporters, and claudins), kidney and nephron segment conservation, and renal electrolyte transport physiology in the zebrafish, we provide researchers and nephrologists with an indication of the possibilities and considerations of the zebrafish as a model for human renal ion transport. Combined with advanced techniques envisioned for the future, implementation of the zebrafish might expand beyond unraveling pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie distinct genetic or environmentally, i.e., pharmacological and lifestyle, induced renal transport deficits. Specifically, the ease of drug administration and the exploitation of improved genetic approaches might argue for the adoption of the zebrafish as a model for preclinical personalized medicine for distinct renal diseases and renal electrolyte transport proteins.},

@article{Lang2007,
 abstract = {A number of ion channels and transporters are expressed in both the inner ear and kidney. In the inner ear, K+ cycling and endolymphatic K +, Na+, Ca2+, and pH homeostasis are critical for normal organ function. Ion channels and transporters involved in K + cycling include K+ channels, Na+-2Cl --K+ cotransporter, Na+/K+-ATPase, Cl- channels, connexins, and K+/Cl- cotransporters. Furthermore, endolymphatic Na+ and Ca2+ homeostasis depends on Ca2+-ATPase, Ca2+ channels, Na + channels, and a purinergic receptor channel. Endolymphatic pH homeostasis involves H+-ATPase and Cl-/HCO 3- exchangers including pendrin. Defective connexins (GJB2 and GJB6), pendrin (SLC26A4), K+ channels (KCNJ10, KCNQ1, KCNE1, and KCNMA1), Na+-2Cl--K+ cotransporter (SLC12A2), K+/Cl+ cotransporters (KCC3 and KCC4), Cl- channels (BSND and CLCNKA + CLCNKB), and H+-ATPase (ATP6V1B1 and ATPV0A4) cause hearing loss. All these channels and transporters are also expressed in the kidney and support renal tubular transport or signaling. The hearing loss may thus be paralleled by various renal phenotypes including a subtle decrease of proximal Na+-coupled transport (KCNE1/KCNQ1), impaired K+ secretion (KCNMA1), limited HCO3- elimination (SLC26A4), NaCl wasting (BSND and CLCNKB), renal tubular acidosis (ATP6V1B1, ATPV0A4, and KCC4), or impaired urinary concentration (CLCNKA). Thus, defects of channels and transporters expressed in the kidney and inner ear result in simultaneous dysfunctions of these seemingly unrelated organs.},

 abstract = {In freshwater fishes, the gill and kidney are intricately involved in ionic and acid-base regulation owing to the presence of numerous ion channels, pumps, or exchangers. This review summarizes recent developments in branchial and renal ion transport physiology and presents several models that integrate epithelial ion and acid-base movements in freshwater fishes. At the gill, three cell types are potentially involved in ionic uptake: pavement cells, mitochondria-rich (MR) PNA+ cells, and MR PNA- cells. The transfer of acidic or basic equivalents between the fish and its environment is accomplished largely by the gill and is appropriately regulated to correct acid-base imbalances. The kidney, while less important than the gill in overall acid or base excretion, has an essential role in regulating systemic acid-base balance by controlling HCO3- reabsorption from the filtrate. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Staruschenko2012,
 abstract = {The central goal of this overview article is to summarize recent findings in renal epithelial transport, focusing chiefly on the connecting tubule (CNT) and the cortical collecting duct (CCD).Mammalian CCD and CNT are involved in fine-tuning of electrolyte and fluid balance throughreabsorption and secretion. Specific transporters and channels mediate vectorial movements ofwater and solutes in these segments. Although only a small percent of the glomerular filtratereaches the CNT and CCD, these segments are critical for water and electrolyte homeostasissince several hormones, for example, aldosterone and arginine vasopressin, exert their maineffects in these nephron sites. Importantly, hormones regulate the function of the entire nephronand kidney by affecting channels and transporters in the CNT and CCD. Knowledge about thephysiological and pathophysiological regulation of transport in the CNT and CCD and particularroles of specific channels/transporters has increased tremendously over the last two decades. Recent studies shed new light on several key questions concerning the regulation of renal transport. Precise distribution patterns of transport proteins in the CCD and CNT will be reviewed, andtheir physiological roles and mechanisms mediating ion transport in these segments will also becovered. Special emphasis will be given to pathophysiological conditions appearing as a result of abnormalities in renal transport in the CNT and CCD. © 2012 American Physiological Society.},

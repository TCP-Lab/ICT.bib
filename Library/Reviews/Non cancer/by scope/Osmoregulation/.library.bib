 abstract = {Teleost fishes are able to acclimatize to seawater by secreting excess NaCl by means of specialized " ionocytes" in the gill epithelium. Antibodies against Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) have been used since 1996 as a marker for identifying branchial ionocytes. Immunohistochemistry of NKA by itself and in combination with Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter and CFTR Cl- channel provided convincing evidence that ionocytes are functional during seawater acclimation, and also revealed morphological variations in ionocytes among teleost species. Recent development of antibodies to freshwater- and seawater-specific isoforms of the NKA alpha-subunit has allowed functional distinction of ion absorptive and secretory ionocytes in Atlantic salmon. Cutaneous ionocytes of tilapia embryos serve as a model for branchial ionocytes, allowing identification of 4 types: two involved in ion uptake, one responsible for salt secretion and one with unknown function. Combining molecular genetics, advanced imaging techniques and immunohistochemistry will rapidly advance our understanding of both the unity and diversity of ionocyte function and regulation in fish osmoregulation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Hwang2007,
 abstract = {Compared to terrestrial animals, fish have to cope with more-challenging osmotic and ionic gradients from aquatic environments with diverse salinities, ion compositions, and pH values. Gills, a unique and highly studied organ in research on fish osmoregulation and ionoregulation, provide an excellent model to study the regulatory mechanisms of ion transport. The present review introduces and discusses some recent advances in relevant issues of teleost gill ion transport and functions of gill ionocytes. Based on accumulating evidence, a conclusive model of NaCl secretion in gills of euryhaline teleosts has been established. Interpretations of results of studies on freshwater fish gill Na+/Cl- uptake mechanisms are still being debated compared with those for NaCl secretion. Current models for Na+/Cl- uptake are proposed based on studies in traditionally used model species. Many reported inconsistencies are claimed to be due to differences among species, various experimental designs, or acclimation conditions. Having the benefit of advanced techniques in molecular/cellular biology, functional genomics, and model animals, several new notions have recently been raised concerning relevant issues of Na+/Cl- uptake pathways. Several new windows have been opened particularly in terms of molecular mechanisms of ionocyte differentiation and energy metabolite transport between gill cells during environmental challenge. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Sakamoto2001,
 abstract = {The mitochondrion-rich cells (MRCs) in teleost gill and equivalent tissues are important osmo-regulatory sites in maintaining ionic balance. These cells express a variety of ion pumps, transporters, and channels, which play central roles in ionic regulation. Recently, two types of MRCs have been identified in euryhaline fishes: seawater (SW)-type MRCs extrude Na and Cl ions in SW conditions; freshwater (FW)-type MRCs take up at least Cl-. Long-term development/differentiation of the two types of MRCs during adaptation to different salinities appears to be regulated mainly by endocrine factors. Osmolality, Ca2+, neurotransmitters, and fast-acting hormones rapidly regulate the SW MRCs. Recent information is assembled in this review and suggests the functional plasticity of highly specialized MRCs.},

@article{Takvam2021,
 abstract = {Euryhaline teleosts exhibit major changes in renal function as they move between freshwater (FW) and seawater (SW) environments, thus tolerating large fluctuations in salinity. In FW, the kidney excretes large volumes of water through high glomerular filtration rates (GFR) and low tubular reabsorption rates, while actively reabsorbing most ions at high rates. The excreted product has a high urine flow rate (UFR) with a dilute composition. In SW, GFR is greatly reduced, and the tubules reabsorb as much water as possible, while actively secreting divalent ions. The excreted product has a low UFR, and is almost isosmotic to the blood plasma, with Mg2+, SO42–, and Cl– as the major ionic components. Early studies at the organismal level have described these basic patterns, while in the last two decades, studies of regulation at the cell and molecular level have been implemented, though only in a few euryhaline groups (salmonids, eels, tilapias, and fugus). There have been few studies combining the two approaches. The aim of the review is to integrate known aspects of renal physiology (reabsorption and secretion) with more recent advances in molecular water and solute physiology (gene and protein function of transporters). The renal transporters addressed include the subunits of the Na+, K+- ATPase (NKA) enzyme, monovalent ion transporters for Na+, Cl–, and K+ (NKCC1, NKCC2, CLC-K, NCC, ROMK2), water transport pathways [aquaporins (AQP), claudins (CLDN)], and divalent ion transporters for SO42–, Mg2+, and Ca2+ (SLC26A6, SLC26A1, SLC13A1, SLC41A1, CNNM2, CNNM3, NCX1, NCX2, PMCA). For each transport category, we address the current understanding at the molecular level, try to synthesize it with classical knowledge of overall renal function, and highlight knowledge gaps. Future research on the kidney of euryhaline fishes should focus on integrating changes in kidney reabsorption and secretion of ions with changes in transporter function at the cellular and molecular level (gene and protein verification) in different regions of the nephrons. An increased focus on the kidney individually and its functional integration with the other osmoregulatory organs (gills, skin and intestine) in maintaining overall homeostasis will have applied relevance for aquaculture.},
